<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>This book has been written for the nontechnical reader&mdash;for
the man or boy who is interested in submarines
and torpedoes, and would like to know something about
the men who invented these things and how they came
to do it. Much has been omitted that I should have
liked to have put in, for this is a small book and the
story of the submarine is much longer than most people
realize. It is perhaps astonishing to think of the launching
of an underseaboat in the year the Pilgrims landed
at Plymouth Rock, or George Washington watching his
submarine attack the British fleet in 1776. But are
these things as astonishing as the thought of European
soldiers wearing steel helmets and fighting with crossbows
and catapults in 1916?</p>

<p>The chapter on “A Trip in a Modern Submarine” is
purely imaginative. There is no such boat in our submarine
flotilla as the <i>X-4</i>. We ought to have plenty of
big, fast, sea-going submarines, with plenty of big, fast
sea-planes and battle-cruisers, so that if an invading army
ever starts for this country we can meet it and smash it
while it is cooped up on transports somewhere in mid-ocean.
There, and not in shallow, off-shore waters,
cumbered with nets and mines, is the true battlefield of
the submarine.</p>

<p>The last part of this book has a broken-off and fragmentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
appearance. This is almost unavoidable at a
time when writing history is like trying to make a statue
of a moving-picture. I have tried to do justice to both
sides in the present war.</p>

<p>I wish to express my thanks to those whose kindness
and courtesy have made it possible for me to write this
book. To Mr. Kelby, Librarian of the New York Historical
Society, I am indebted for much information about
Bushnell’s <i>Turtle</i>, and to Mrs. Daniel Whitney, of Germantown,
Pa., a descendant of Ezra Lee, for the portrait
of her intrepid ancestor. Both the Electric Boat
Company and Mr. Simon Lake have supplied me most
generously with information and pictures. The Bureau
of Construction, United States Navy, E.&nbsp;P. Dutton &amp;
Company, publishers of Mr. Alan H. Burgoyne’s “Submarine
Navigation Past and Present”; the American
Magazine, Flying, International Marine Engineering, the
<i>Scientific American</i>, and the <i>New York Sun</i> have cheerfully
given permission for the reproduction of many pictures
of which they hold the copyright. Albert Frank
&amp; Company have given the cut of the advertisement of
the last sailing of the <i>Lusitania</i>. Special thanks are due
to Mr. A. Russell Bond, Associate Editor of the <i>Scientific
American</i>, for expert advice and suggestion.</p>

<p>Some well-known pictures of submarines are herein
credited for the first time to the man who made them:
Captain Francis M. Barber, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N. (retired). This
officer published a little pink-backed pamphlet on submarine
boats&mdash;the first book devoted exclusively to this
subject&mdash;in 1875.</p>

<p>“The last time I heard of that pink pamphlet,” writes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
Captain Barber from Washington, “was when I was
Naval Attache at Berlin in 1898. Admiral von Tirpitz
was then head of the Torpedo Bureau in the Navy Department,
and he was good enough to say that it was the
foundation of his studies&mdash;and look what we have now
in the terrible German production.”</p>

<p>The idea of submarine navigation is much older than
1624. Crude diving bells, and primitive leather diving
helmets, with bladders to keep the upper end of the air
tube afloat on the surface of the water, were used as early
as the fourteenth century. William Bourne, an Englishman
who published a book on “Inventions or Devices”
in 1578, suggested the military value of a boat that could
be sailed just below the surface of the water, with a
hollow mast for a ventilator. John Napier, Laird of
Merchiston, the great Scotch mathematician who invented
logarithms, wrote in 1596 about his proposed “Devices
of sailing under the water, with divers other devices and
stratagems for the burning of enemies.”</p>

<p>But the first man actually to build and navigate a submarine
was a Dutchman: the learned Doctor Cornelius
Van Drebel.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> He was “a native of Alkmaar, a very
fair and handsome man, and of very gentle manners.”
Both his pleasing personality and his knowledge of science&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
caused many to suspect him of being a
magician&mdash;made the Netherlander an honored guest
at the court of his most pedantic Majesty, King James I
of England.</p>

<p>Van Drebel was
walking along the
banks of the
Thames, one pleasant
evening in the
year 1620, when he
“noticed some sailors
dragging behind
their barques baskets
full of fish; he saw
that the barques were
weighed down in the
water, but that they
rose a little when the
baskets allowed the
ropes which held
them to slacken a
little. The idea occurred
to him that a
ship could be held
under water by a
somewhat similar method and could be propelled by oars
and poles.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

  <div class="caption smaller notbold">Reproduced from “Submarine Navigation,
    Past and Present” by Alan H. Burgoyne,
    by permission of E.&nbsp;P. Dutton &amp; Company.</div>
</div>

<p>Lodged by the king in Eltham Palace, and supplied
with funds from the royal treasury, Van Drebel designed
and built three submarine boats, between 1620 and 1624.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
They were simply large wooden rowboats, decked over
and made water-tight by a covering of thick, well-greased
leather. Harsdoffer, a chronicler of the period,
declared that</p>

<p>“King James himself journeyed in one of them on
the Thames. There were on this occasion twelve rowers
besides the passengers, and the vessel during several
hours was kept at a depth of twelve to fifteen feet below
the surface.”</p>

<p>Another contemporary historian, Cornelius Van der
Wonde, of Van Drebel’s home town, said of him:</p>

<p>“He built a ship in which one could row and navigate
under water from Westminster to Greenwich, the distance
of two Dutch miles; even five or six miles or as far as
one pleased. In this boat a person could see under the
surface of the water and without candle-light, as much
as he needed to read in the Bible or any other book. Not
long ago this remarkable ship was yet to be seen lying in
the Thames or London river.”</p>

<p>The glow of phosphorescent bodies, suggested by the
monk Mersenne for illuminating the interior of a submarine,
later in the seventeenth century and actually so
used by Bushnell in the eighteenth, might have furnished
sufficient light for Bible-&nbsp;and compass-reading on this
voyage. But how did King James&mdash;the first and last
monarch to venture on an underwater voyage&mdash;the other
passengers, and the twelve rowers get enough air?</p>

<p>“That deservedly Famous Mechanician and Chymist,
Cornelius Drebell ... conceived, that ’tis not only the
whole body of the air but a certain Quintessence (as
Chymists speake) or spirituous part that makes it fit for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
respiration ... so that (for aught I could gather) besides
the Mechanicall contrivance of his vessel he had a
Chymicall liquor, which he accounted the chief secret
of his Submarine Navigation. For when from time to
time he perceived that the finer and purer part of the air
was consumed or over-clogged by the respiration and
steames of those that went in his ship, he would, by
unstopping a vessel full of liquor speedily restore to the
troubled air such a proportion of vital parts as would
make it again for a good while fit for Respiration.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>Did Van Drebel anticipate by one hundred and fifty
years the discovery of oxygen: the life-giving “Quintessence”
of air? Even if he did, it is incredible that he
should have found a liquid, utterly unknown to modern
chemistry, capable of giving off that gas so freely that
a few gallons would restore the oxygen to a confined body
of air as fast as fifteen or twenty men could consume it
by breathing. Perhaps his “Chymicall liquor” instead
of producing oxygen directly, increased the proportion
of it in the atmosphere by absorbing the carbonic acid
gas.</p>

<p>The Abbé de Hautefeullie, who wrote in 1680 on
“Methods of breathing under water,” made the following
shrewd guess at the nature of the apparatus:</p>

<p>“Drebel’s secret was probably the machine which I
had imagined, consisting of a bellows with two valves
and two tubes resting on the surface of the water, the one
bringing down air and the other sending it back. By
speaking of a volatile essence which restored the nitrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
parts consumed by respiration, Drebel evidently wished
to disguise his invention and prevent others from finding
out its real nature.”</p>

<p>It is a very great pity that we know no more about
these earliest submarines. Cornelius Van Drebel died
in 1634, at the age of sixty-two, without leaving any
written notes or oral descriptions. We must not think
too hardly of this inventor of three centuries ago, unguarded
by patent laws, for making a mystery of his
discoveries. He had to be a showman as well as a scientist,
or his noble patrons would have lost all interest in
his “ingenious machines,” and mystery is half of the
showman’s game. Besides his “eel-boats,” Van Drebel
is said to have invented a wonderful globe with which
he imitated perpetual motion and illustrated the course
of the sun, moon, and stars; an incubator, a refrigerator,
“Virginals that played of themselves,” and other marvels
too numerous to mention. Half scientist, half charlatan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
wholly medieval in appearance, with his long furred gown
and long, fair beard, Cornelius Van Drebel marches picturesquely
at the head of the procession of inventors who
have made possible the modern submarine.</p>

<p>Eighteen years after Van Drebel’s death, a Frenchman
named Le Son built a submarine at Rotterdam. This
craft, which is usually referred to as the <i>Rotterdam
Boat</i>, was 72 feet long, 12 feet high, and of 8 foot beam.
It was built of wood, with sharply tapering ends, and had
a superstructure whose sloping sides were designed to
deflect cannon balls that might be fired at the boat while
traveling on the surface, while iron-shod legs protected
the hull when resting on the sea bottom. A single paddle-wheel
amidships was to propel the boat,&mdash;just how, the
inventor never revealed. Like so many other submarines,
the <i>Rotterdam Boat</i> was built primarily to be
used against the British fleet. But it failed to interest
either the Dutch or French minister of marine, and never
went into action.</p>

<p>The earliest known contemporary picture of a submarine
vessel appeared in the “Gentleman’s Magazine,”
in 1747. It showed a cross section of an underwater
boat built and navigated on the Thames by one Symons.
This was a decked-over row-boat, propelled by four pairs
of oars working in water-tight joints of greased leather.
To submerge his vessel, Symons admitted water into a
number of large leather bottles, placed inside the hull
with their open mouth passing through holes in the bottom.
When he wished to rise, he would squeeze out
the water with a lever and bind up the neck of each
emptied bottle with string. This ingenious device was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
not original with Mr. Symons, but was invented by a
Frenchman named Borelli in 1680.</p>

<p>Submarine navigation was a century and a half old
before it claimed its first victim. J. Day, an English
mechanic, rebuilt a small boat so that he was able to
submerge it in thirty feet of water, with himself on
board, and remain there for twenty-four hours with no
ill effect. At the end of this time, Day rose to the surface,
absolutely certain of his ability to repeat the experiment
at any depth. But how could he turn this to
practical account?</p>

<div id="ip_10" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_010.jpg" width="600" height="297" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Symons’s Submarine.</div></div>

<p>It was an age of betting, when gentlemen could always
be found to risk money on any wager, however fantastic.
Day found a financial backer in a Mr. Blake, who
advanced him the money to buy a fifty-ton sloop and
fit it with a strong water-tight compartment amidships.
Ten tons of ballast were placed in the hold and twenty
more hung outside the hull by four iron rods passing
through the passenger’s compartment. When the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of the boat was filled with water, it would sink to the
bottom, to rise again when the man inside released the
twenty tons of outer ballast.</p>

<p>Shut in the water-tight compartment of this boat, Day
sank to the bottom of Plymouth Harbor, at 2 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, Tuesday,
June 28, 1774, to decide a bet that he could remain
twelve hours at a depth of twenty-two fathoms (132
feet). When, at the expiration of this time, the submarine
failed to reappear, Mr. Blake called on the captain
of a near-by frigate for help. Bluejackets from the
warship and workmen from the dockyard were set to
work immediately to grapple for the sunken craft and
raise her to the surface, but to no avail. The great
pressure of water at that depth&mdash;150 feet is the limit
of safety for many modern submarines&mdash;must have
crushed in the walls of the water-tight compartment without
giving Day time enough to release the outer ballast
and rise to safety.</p>

<span class="subhead">DAVID BUSHNELL’S “TURTLE”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the first week of September, 1776, the American
army defending New York still held Manhattan Island,
but nothing more. Hastily improvised, badly
equipped, and worse disciplined, it had been easily defeated
by a superior invading force of British regulars
and German mercenaries in the battle of Long Island.
Brooklyn had fallen; from Montauk Point to the East
River, all was the enemy’s country. Staten Island, too,
was an armed and hostile land. After the fall of the
forts on both sides of the Narrows, the British fleet
had entered the Upper Bay, and even landed marines and
infantry on Governor’s Island. Grimly guarding the
crowded transports, the ship-of-the-line <i>Asia</i> and the
frigate <i>Eagle</i> lay a little above Staten Island, with their
broadsides trained on the doomed city.</p>

<p>In the mouth of the North River, not a biscuit-toss
from the Battery, floated the brass conning-tower of an
American submarine.</p>

<p>It was the only submarine in the world and its inventor
called it the <i>Turtle</i>. He called it that because it
looked like one: a turtle floating with its tail down and
a conning-tower for a head. It has also been compared
to a modern soldier’s canteen with an extra-large mouthpiece,
or a hardshell clam wearing a silk hat. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
deeper than it was long and not much longer than it
was broad. It had no periscope, torpedo tubes, or cage
of white mice. But the <i>Turtle</i> was a submarine, for all
that.</p>

<p>Its inventor was a Connecticut Yankee, Mr. David
Bushnell, later Captain
Bushnell of the corps
of sappers and miners
and in the opinion of
his Excellency General
Washington “a man
of great mechanical
powers, fertile in invention
and master of
execution.” Bushnell
was born in Saybrook
and educated at Yale,
where he graduated
with the class of 1775.
During his four years
as an undergraduate,
he spent most of his
spare time solving the
problem of exploding
gunpowder under water.
A water-tight case would keep his powder dry, but
how could he get a spark inside to explode it? Percussion
caps had not yet been invented, but Bushnell took the
flintlock from a musket and had it snapped by clockwork
that could be wound up and set for any desired length

  <span class="smaller">(As described by its operator.)</span></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“The first experiment I made,” wrote Bushnell in a
letter to Thomas Jefferson when the latter was American
minister to France in 1789, “was with about 2 ounces
of powder, which I exploded 4 feet under water, to prove
to some of the first personages in Connecticut that
powder would take fire under water.</p>

<p>“The second experiment was made with 2 lb. of
powder enclosed in a wooden bottle and fixed under a
hogshead, with a 2-inch oak plank between the hogshead
and the powder. The hogshead was loaded with
stones as deep as it could swim; a wooden pipe, descending
through the lower head of the hogshead and through
the plank into the bottle, was primed with powder. A
match put to the priming exploded the powder, which
produced a very great effect, rending the plank into
pieces, demolishing the hogshead, and casting the stones
and the ruins of the hogshead, with a body of water,
many feet into the air, to the astonishment of the spectators.
This experiment was likewise made for the satisfaction
of the gentlemen above mentioned.”</p>

<p>Governor Trumbull of Connecticut was among the
“first personages” present at these experiments, which
so impressed him and his council that they appropriated
enough money for Bushnell to build the <i>Turtle</i>. The
Nutmeg State was thus the first “world-power” to have
a submarine in its navy.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The hull of the <i>Turtle</i> was not made of copper, as is
sometimes stated, but was “built of oak, in the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
manner possible, corked and tarred.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The conning-tower
was of brass and also served as a hatch-cover.
The hatchway was barely big enough for the one man
who made up the entire crew to squeeze through. Once
inside, the operator could screw the cover down tight,
and look out through “three round doors, one directly
in front and one on each side, large enough to put the
hand through. When open they admitted fresh air.”
On top of the conning-tower were two air-pipes “so constructed
that they shut themselves whenever the water
rose near their tops, so that no water could enter through
them and opened themselves immediately after they rose
above the water.</p>

<p>“The vessel was chiefly ballasted with lead fixed to its
bottom; when this was not sufficient a quantity was
placed within, more or less according to the weight of
the operator; its ballast made it so stiff that there was
no danger of oversetting. The vessel, with all its appendages
and the operator, was of sufficient weight to settle
it very low in the water. About 200 lb. of lead at
the bottom for ballast could be let down 40 or 50 feet
below the vessel; this enabled the operator to rise instantly
to the surface of the water in case of accident.”</p>

<p>The operator sat on an oaken brace that kept the two
sides of the boat from being crushed in by the water-pressure,
and did things with his hands and feet. He
must have been as busy as a cathedral organist on Easter
morning. With one foot he opened a brass valve that let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
water into the ballast tanks, with the other he worked
a force pump to drive it out. When he had reached an
approximate equilibrium, he could move the submarine
up or down, or hold it at any desired depth, by cranking
a small vertical-acting propellor placed just forward of
the conning-tower on the deck above. Before him was
the crank of another propellor, or rather tractor, for it
drew, not pushed, the vessel forward. Behind him was
the rudder, which the operator controlled with a long
curved tiller stuck under one arm.</p>

  <div class="caption vspace">The Best-known Picture of Bushnell’s <i>Turtle</i>.<br />
  <span class="smaller">Drawn by Lieutenant F. M. Barber, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., in 1875.</span></div></div>

<p>Bushnell, in his letter to Jefferson, calls each of these
propellors “an oar, formed upon the principle of the
screw,” and the best-known picture of the <i>Turtle</i> shows
a bearded gentleman in nineteenth-century clothes boring
his way through the water with two big gimlets. But
Sergeant Ezra Lee of the Connecticut Line, who did the
actual operating, described the submarine’s forward propellor
(he makes no mention of the other) as having two
wooden blades or “oars, of about 12 inches in length
and 4 or 5 in width, shaped like the arms of a windmill.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Except in size, this device must have looked very
much like the wooden-bladed tractor of a modern aeroplane.</p>

<p>“These oars,” noted Judge Griswold on the letter
before forwarding it to General Humphrey, “were fixed
on the end of a shaft like windmill arms projected out
forward, and turned at right angles with the course of
the machine; and upon the same principles that wind-mill
arms are turned by the wind, these oars, when put in
motion as the writer describes, draw the machine slowly
after it. This moving power is small, and every attendant
circumstance must coöperate with it to answer the
purpose&mdash;calm waters and no current.”</p>

<p>“With hard labor,” said Lee, “the machine might be
impelled at the rate of ‘3 nots’ an hour for a short
time.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Lee volunteered “to learn the ways and mystery
of this new machine” because the original operator,
Bushnell’s brother, “was taken sick in the campaign of
1776 at New York before he had an opportunity to make
use of his skill, and never recovered his health sufficiently
afterwards.” While Lee was still struggling with the
“mystery” in practice trips on Long Island Sound, the
British fleet entered New York Harbor. The submarine
was at once hurried to New Rochelle, carted overland to
the Hudson, and towed down to the city.</p>

<p>At slack tide on the first calm night after his arrival,
Lee screwed down the conning-tower of the <i>Turtle</i> above
his head and set out to attack the British fleet.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
whaleboats towed him as near as they dared and then
cast off. Running awash, with not more than six or
seven inches of the conning-tower exposed, the submarine
crept, silent and unseen, down the bay and up under the
towering stern of his Britannic Majesty’s 64-gun frigate
<i>Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>“When I rowed under the stern of the ship,” wrote
Sergeant Lee in after years, “I could see the men on
deck and hear them talk. I then shut down all the
doors, sunk down and came under the bottom of the
ship.”</p>

<p>Up through the top of the submarine ran a long sharp
gimlet, not for boring a hole through the bottom of a
ship, but to be screwed into the wooden hull and left there,
to serve as an anchor for a mine. Tied to the screw and
carried on the after-deck of the <i>Turtle</i> was an egg-shaped
“magazine,” made of two hollowed-out pieces of oak
and containing one hundred and fifty pounds of gunpowder,
with a clockwork time-fuse that would begin
to run as soon as the operator cast off the magazine after
making fast the screw. Everything seemed ready for
Sergeant Lee to anticipate Lieutenant Commander Von
Weddigen by one hundred and thirty-eight years.</p>

<p>But no matter how hard the strong-wristed sergeant
turned the handle, he could not drive the screw into the
frigate’s hull. The <i>Eagle</i> was copper-sheathed!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>“I pulled along to try another place,” said Lee, “but
deviated a little to one side and immediately rose with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
great velocity and came above the surface 2 or 3 feet,
between the ship and the daylight, then sunk again like
a porpoise. I hove about to try again, but on further
thought I gave out, knowing that as soon as it was light
the ships’ boats would be rowing in all directions, and I
thought the best generalship was to retreat as fast as I
could, as I had 4 miles to go before passing Governor’s
Island. So I jogg’d on as fast as I could.”</p>

<p>To enable him to steer a course when submerged, Lee
had before him a compass, most ingeniously illuminated
with phosphorescent pieces of rotten wood. But for
some reason this proved to be of no use.</p>

  <div class="caption">Another Idea of Bushnell’s <i>Turtle</i>.</div></div>

<p>“I was obliged to rise up every few minutes to see
that I sailed in the right direction, and for this purpose
keeping the machine on the surface of the water and the
doors open. I was much afraid of getting aground on
the island, as the tide of the flood set on the north point.</p>

<p>“While on my passage up to the city, my course, owing
to the above circumstances, was very crooked and zig-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>zag,
and the enemy’s attention was drawn towards me
from Governor’s Island. When I was abreast of the
fort on the island, 3 or 400 men got upon the parapet to
observe me; at length a number came down to the shore,
shoved off a 12 oar’d barge with 5 or 6 sitters and pulled
for me. I eyed them, and when they had got within 50
or 60 yards of me I let loose the magazine in hopes that
if they should take me they would likewise pick up the
magazine, and then we should all be blown up together.
But as kind Providence would have it, they took fright
and returned to the island to my infinite joy. I then
weathered the island, and our people seeing me, came off
with a whaleboat and towed me in. The magazine, after
getting a little past the island, went off with a tremendous
explosion, throwing up large bodies of water to an immense
height.”</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, the British forces landed on
Manhattan Island at what is now the foot of East Thirty-fourth
Street, and Washington’s army hastily withdrew
to the Harlem Heights, above One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
Street. A British frigate sailed up the Hudson and
anchored off Bloomingdale, or between Seventy-second
and One Hundred and Tenth Streets, in the same waters
where our Atlantic fleet lies whenever it comes to town.
Here Sergeant Lee in the <i>Turtle</i> made two more attempts.
But the first time he was discovered by the watch, and
when he approached again, submerged, the phosphorus-painted
cork that served as an indicator in his crude but
ingenious depth-gage, got caught and deceived him so
that he dived completely under the warship without touching
her. Shortly after this, the frigate came up the river,
overhauled the sloop on which the <i>Turtle</i> was being transported,
and sent it to the bottom, submarine and all.</p>

“Though I afterwards recovered the vessel,” Bushnell
wrote to Jefferson, “I found it impossible at that time
to prosecute the design any further. I had been in a bad
state of health from the beginning of my undertaking,
and was now very unwell; the situation of public affairs
was such that I despaired of obtaining the public attention
and the assistance necessary. I was unable to support
myself and the persons I must have employed had I
proceeded. Besides, I found it absolutely necessary that
the operators should acquire more skill in the management
of the vessel before I could expect success, which
would have taken up some time, and no small additional
expense. I therefore gave over the pursuit for that time
and waited for a more favorable opportunity, which never
arrived.</p>

<p>“In the year 1777 I made an attempt from a whaleboat
against the <i>Cerberus</i> frigate, then lying at anchor
between Connecticut River and New London, by drawing
a machine against her side by means of a line. The machine
was loaded with powder, to be exploded by a gun-lock,
which was to be unpinioned by an apparatus to be
turned by being brought alongside of the frigate. This
machine fell in with a schooner at anchor astern of the
frigate, and concealed from my sight. By some means
or other it was fired, and demolished the schooner and
three men, and blew the only one left alive overboard,
who was taken up very much hurt.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
“After this I fixed several kegs under water, charged
with powder, to explode upon touching anything as they
floated along with the tide. I set them afloat in the
Delaware, above the English shipping at Philadelphia, in
December, 1777. I was unacquainted with the river, and
obliged to depend upon a gentleman very imperfectly
acquainted with that part of it, as I afterwards found.
We went as near the shipping as we durst venture; I believe
the darkness of the night greatly deceived him, as
it did me. We set them adrift to fall with the ebb upon
the shipping. Had we been within sixty rods I believe
they must have fallen in with them immediately, as I
designed; but, as I afterwards found, they were set adrift
much too far distant, and did not arrive until, after being
detained some time by frost, they advanced in the day-time
in a dispersed situation and under great disadvantages.
One of them blew up a boat with several persons
in it who imprudently handled it too freely, and thus gave
the British the alarm which brought on the battle of the
kegs.”</p>

<p>The agitated redcoats lined the banks and blazed away
at every bit of drifting wreckage in the river, as described
by a sarcastic Revolutionary poet in “The Battle
of the Kegs.”</p>

<p>David Bushnell was later captured by the British, who
failed to recognize him and soon released him as a harmless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
civilian. After the Revolution he went to France,
and then to Georgia, where disgusted with the Government’s
neglect of himself and his invention he changed
his name to “Dr. Bush.” He was eighty-four years old
when he died in 1826. His identity was then revealed
in his will.</p>

<p>Bushnell found the submarine boat a useless plaything
and made it a formidable weapon. To him it owes the
propellor, the conning-tower, and the first suggestion of
the torpedo. The <i>Turtle</i> was not only the first American
submarine but the forerunner of the undersea destroyer
of to-day.</p>

<p>“I thought and still think that it was an effort of
genius,” declared George Washington to Thomas Jefferson,
“but that too many things were necessary to be
combined to expect much against an enemy who are always
on guard.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ROBERT FULTON’S “NAUTILUS”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Robert</span> Fulton was probably the first American
who ever went to Paris for the purpose of selling
war-supplies to the French government. Unlike his compatriots
of to-day, he found anything but a ready market.
For three years, beginning in 1797, Fulton tried constantly
but vainly to interest the Directory in his plans
for a submarine. Though a commission appointed to
examine his designs reported favorably, the minister of
marine would have nothing to do with them. Fulton
built a beautiful little model submarine of mahogany and
exhibited it, but with no results. He made an equally
fruitless attempt to sell his invention to Holland, then
called the Batavian Republic. Nobody seemed to have
the slightest belief or interest in submarines.</p>

<p>But Fulton was a persistent man or he would never
have got his name into the history books. He stayed in
Paris, where his friend Joel Barlow was American minister,
and supported himself by inventing and exhibiting
what he called “the pictures”: the first moving pictures
the world had ever seen. These were panoramas, where
the picture was not thrown on the screen by a lantern but
painted on it, and the long roll of painted canvas was
unrolled like a film between two large spools on opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
sides of the stage. Very few people remember that
Robert Fulton invented the panorama, though only a
generation ago the great panorama of the battle of
Gettysburg drew and thrilled as large audiences as a
film like “The Birth of a Nation” does to-day. Fulton
painted his own panoramas himself, for he was an artist
before he was an engineer. He made three of them and
had to build a separate little theater to show each one in.
The Parisians were so well pleased with this novelty that
they made up a song about the panoramas, and the street
where the most popular of the three was shown is still
called “La Rue Fulton.” The picture that won the inventor
this honor was a panorama of the burning of
Moscow&mdash;not the burning of the city to drive out Napoleon,
for that came a dozen years later, but an earlier
conflagration, some time in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Napoleon overthrew the Directory and became First
Consul and absolute ruler of France in 1800. He appointed
three expert naval engineers to examine Fulton’s
plans, and on their approval, Napoleon advanced him
10,000 francs to build a submarine.</p>

<p>Construction was begun at once and the boat was finished
in May, 1801. She was a remarkably modern-looking
craft, and a great improvement on everything
that had gone before. She was the first submarine to
have a fish-shaped, metal hull. It was built of copper
plating on iron ribs, and was 21 feet 3 inches long and
6 feet 5 inches in diameter at the thickest point, which
was well forward. A heavy keel gave stability and immediately
above it were the water-ballast tanks for submerging
the vessel. Two men propelled the boat when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
beneath the surface by turning a hand-winch geared to
the shaft of a two-bladed, metal propellor. (Fulton
called the propellor a “fly,” and got the idea of it from
the little windmill-shaped device placed in the throat of
an old-fashioned fireplace to be revolved by the hot air
passing up the chimney and used to turn the roasting-spit
in many a French kitchen for centuries past.) The
third member of the crew stood in the dome-shaped conning-tower
and steered, while Fulton himself controlled
the pumps, valves, and the diving-planes or horizontal
rudders that steered the submarine up and down. Instead
of forcing his boat under with a vertical-acting
screw, like Bushnell and Nordenfelt (see pages 16 and 62),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Fulton, like Holland, made her dive bow-foremost by depressing
her nose with the diving-planes and shoving her
under by driving her ahead. Fulton was also the first
to give a submarine separate means of propulsion for
above and below the surface. Just as a modern undersea
boat uses oil-engines whenever it can and saves its
storage batteries for use when submerged, Fulton spared
the strength of his screw by rigging the <i>Nautilus</i> with
a mast and sail. By pulling a rope from inside the
vessel, the sail could be shut up like a fan, and the
hinged mast lowered and stowed away in a groove on
deck. Later a jib was added to the mainsail, and the
two combined gave the <i>Nautilus</i> a surface speed of two
knots an hour. She is the only submarine on record
that could go faster below the water than above it, for
her two-man-power propellor bettered this by half a knot.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Her method of attack was the same as the <i>Turtle’s</i>.
Up through the top of the conning-tower projected what
Fulton called the “Horn of the Nautilus.” This was
an eyeleted spike, to be driven into the bottom of a hostile
ship and left there. From a windlass carried in a water-tight
forward compartment of the submarine, a thin,
strong tow-rope ran through the eyehole in the spike to
the trigger of a flintlock inside a copper case nearly full
of gunpowder, which was not carried on deck, as on the
<i>Turtle</i>, but towed some distance astern. As soon as this
powder-case came to a full stop against the spike, the
tow-rope would pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton felt the lack of a distinctive name for
such an under-water charge of explosives, till he thought
of its likeness to the electric ray, that storage battery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of a fish that gives a most unpleasant shock to any one
touching it. So he took the first half of this creature’s
scientific name: <i>Torpedo electricus</i>. Fulton had a knack
for picking good names. He called his submarine the
<i>Nautilus</i> because it had a sail which it opened and folded
away even as the beautiful shellfish of that name was
supposed to furl and unfurl its large, sail-like membrane.</p>

<p>On her first trial on the Seine at Paris, in May, 1801,
the <i>Nautilus</i> remained submerged for twenty minutes
with Fulton and one other man on board, and a lighted
candle for them to navigate by. This consumed too
much air, however, so a small glass window was placed
in the conning-tower, and gave light enough instead.
Four men were then able to remain under for an hour.
After that, Fulton made the first compressed-air tank,
a copper globe containing a cubic foot of compressed
air, by drawing on which the submarine’s crew could
stay under for six hours. This was in the harbor of
Brest, where the <i>Nautilus</i> had been taken overland. A
trial attack was made on an old bulk, which was successfully
blown up. The submarine also proved its ability
either to furl its sails and dive quickly out of sight, or to
cruise for a considerable distance on the surface. Once
it sailed for seventy miles down the English Channel.</p>

<p>Fulton had planned a submarine campaign for scaring
the British navy and merchant marine out of the narrow
seas and so bringing Great Britain to her knees, more
than a century before the German emperor proclaimed
his famous “war zone” around the British Isles. In
one of his letters to the Directory, the American inventor
declared that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
“The enormous commerce of England, no less than its
monstrous Government, depends upon its military marine.
Should some vessels of war be destroyed by means so
novel, so hidden, and so incalculable, the confidence of
the seamen will vanish and the fleet will be rendered useless
from the moment of the first terror.”</p>

<p>To a friend in America, Fulton wrote from Paris on
November 20, 1798:</p>

<p>“I would ask any one if all the American difficulties
during this war are not owing to the naval systems of
Europe and a licensed robbery on the ocean? How then
is America to prevent this? Certainly not by attempting
to build a fleet to cope with the fleets of Europe, but if
possible by rendering the European fleets useless.”</p>

<p>Fulton began his campaign by an attack on two brigs,
the nearest vessels of the English blockading fleet. But
whenever the <i>Nautilus</i> left port for this purpose, both
brigs promptly stood out to sea and remained there till
the submarine went home. Unknown to Fulton, his actions
were being closely watched by the English secret
service, whose spies were always able to send a timely
warning to the British fleet. During the day time, when
the <i>Nautilus</i> was about, the warships were kept under full
sail, with lookouts in the crosstrees watching with telescopes
for the first glimpse of its sail or conning-tower.
At night, the frigates and ships-of-the-line were guarded
by picket-boats rowing round and round them, just as
modern dreadnoughts are guarded by destroyers.</p>

<p>Disappointed by the lack of results, the French naval
authorities refused either to let Fulton build a larger
and more efficient submarine, or to grant commissions in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the navy to him and his crew. He wanted some assurance
that in case they were captured they would not be
hanged by the British, who then as now denounced submarine
warfare by others as little better than piracy. To
guarantee their own safety, Fulton proposed that the
French government threaten to retaliate by hanging an
equal number of English prisoners, but it was pointed out
to him that this would only lead to further executions
by the British, who had many more French prisoners of
war than there were captive Englishmen in France.</p>

<p>Napoleon had lost faith in the submarine, nor could
Fulton interest him in a steamboat which he now built
and operated on the Seine, till it was sunk by the weight
of the machinery breaking the hull in two. So Fulton
quit France and crossed over to England, where Mr.
Pitt, the prime minister, was very much interested in his
inventions.</p>

<p>Fulton succeeded in planting one of his torpedoes under
an old empty Danish brig, the <i>Dorothea</i>, in Deal Harbor,
in front of Walmer Castle, Pitt’s own residence, on October
15, 1805. The prime minister had had to hurry
back to London, but there were many naval officers
present, and one of them declared loudly that he would
be quite unconcerned if he were sitting at dinner at that
moment in the cabin of the <i>Dorothea</i>. Ten minutes later
the clockwork ran out and the torpedo exploded, breaking
the brig in two amidships and hurling the fragments
high in the air. The success of this experiment
was not entirely pleasing to the heads of the British navy.
Their opinion was voiced by Admiral Lord St. Vincent,
who declared that:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
“Pitt was the greatest fool that ever existed, to encourage
a mode of war which they who command the
seas did not want and which if successful would deprive
them of it.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Destruction of the <i>Dorothea</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller">From a woodcut by Robert Fulton.</p></div></div>

<p>Six days after the destruction of the <i>Dorothea</i>, the sea-power
of France was broken by Nelson at the battle
of Trafalgar. Napoleon now gave up all hope of gaining
the few hours’ control of the Channel that would
have enabled him to invade England, and broke up the
camp of his Grand Army that had waited so long at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Boulogne. With this danger gone, England was no
longer interested in submarines and torpedoes. So Fulton
returned to America, to build the <i>Clairmont</i> and win
his place in history. But to him, steam navigation was
far less important than submarine warfare. In the letter
to his old friend Joel Barlow, dated New York, August
22, 1807, in which he described the first voyage of the
<i>Clairmont</i> up the Hudson, Fulton said:</p>

<p>“However, I will not admit that it is half so important
as the torpedo system of defense or attack, for out of this
will grow the liberty of the seas&mdash;an object of infinite
importance to the welfare of America and every civilized
country. But thousands of witnesses have now seen the
steamboat in rapid movement and they believe; but they
have not seen a ship of war destroyed by a torpedo, and
they do not believe. We cannot expect people in general
to have knowledge of physics or power to reason from
cause to effect, but in case we have war and the enemy’s
ships come into our waters, if the government will give
me reasonable means of action, I will soon convince the
world that we have surer and cheaper modes of defense
than they are aware of.”</p>

<p>Fulton had been having his troubles with the navy department.
Soon after his return to this country he had
made his usual demonstration of torpedoing a small anchored
vessel, but it was not until 1810 that he was given
the opportunity to make a test attack on a United States
warship. But stout old Commodore Rogers, who had
been entrusted with the defense of the brig <i>Argus</i>, under
which Fulton was to plant a torpedo, anchored the vessel
in shallow water, stretched a tight wall of spars and netting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
all round her, and successfully defied the inventor
to blow her up. Even a modern destroyer or submarine
would be puzzled to get past this defense. Though compelled
to admit his failure, Fulton pointed out that “a
system then in its infancy, which compelled a hostile
vessel to guard herself by such extraordinary means,
could not fail of becoming a most important mode of warfare.”</p>

<p>It was a great triumph for conservatism&mdash;the same
spirit of conservatism that threatens to send our navy
into its next war with no battle-cruisers, too few scouts
and sea-planes, and the slowest dreadnoughts in the world.
Though Fulton published a wonderful little book on
“Torpedo War and Submarine Explosions” in New
York in 1810, the United States navy made no use of it
in the War of 1812. A privateer submarine from Connecticut
made three dives under the British battleship
<i>Ramillies</i> off New London, but failed to attach a torpedo
for the old reason: copper sheathing. Further attacks
were prevented by the captain of the <i>Ramillies</i>, who gave
notice that he had had a number of American prisoners
placed on board as hostages. Fulton himself was hard
at work superintending the building both of the <i>Demologos</i>,
the first steam-propelled battleship, and the <i>Mute</i>,
a large armored submarine that was to carry a silent engine
and a crew of eighty men, when he died in 1815.</p>

<span class="subhead">SUBMARINES IN THE CIVIL WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> most powerful battleship in the world, half a
century ago, was the U.S.S. <i>New Ironsides</i>. She
was a wooden-hulled, ship-rigged steamer of 3486 tons
displacement&mdash;about one tenth the size of a modern
superdreadnought&mdash;her sides plated with four inches
of iron armor, and carrying twenty heavy guns. On the
night of October 5, 1863, the <i>New Ironsides</i> was on blockade
duty off Charleston Harbor, when Ensign Howard,
the officer of the deck, saw something approaching that
looked like a floating plank. He hailed it, and was answered
by a rifle ball that stretched him, mortally
wounded, on the deck. An instant later came the flash
and roar of a tremendous explosion, a column of water
shot high into the air alongside, and the <i>New Ironsides</i>
was shaken violently from stem to stern.</p>

<p>The Confederate submarine <i>David</i> had crept up and
driven a spar-torpedo against Goliath’s armor.</p>

<p>But except for a few splintered timbers, a flooded engine-room,
and a marine’s broken leg, no damage had
been done. As the Confederate craft was too close and
too low in the water for the broadside guns to bear, the
crew of the ironclad lined the rail and poured volley
after volley of musketry into their dimly seen adversary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
till she drifted away into the night. Her crew of seven
men had dived overboard at the moment of impact, and
were all picked up by different vessels of the blockading
fleet, except the engineer and one other, who swam back
to the <i>David</i>, started her engine again, and brought her
safely home to Charleston.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Views of a Confederate <i>David</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller">From Scharf’s History of the Confederate States Navy.</p></div></div>

<p>The <i>David</i> was a cigar-shaped steam launch, fifty-four
feet long and six feet broad at the thickest point. Projecting
from her bow was a fifteen-foot spar, with a torpedo
charged with sixty pounds of gunpowder at the end
of it. This was exploded by the heat given off by certain
chemicals, after they were shaken up together by the impact
of the torpedo against the enemy’s ship. The <i>David</i>,
steaming at her full speed of seven knots an hour, struck
squarely against the <i>New Ironsides</i> at the water-line and
rebounded to a distance of seven or eight feet before
this clumsy detonator could do its work. When the explosion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
came, the intervening body of water prevented it
from doing any great damage.</p>

<p>The <i>David</i> was not a true submarine but a surface torpedo
boat, that could be submerged till only the funnel
and a small pilot-house were exposed. A number of
other <i>Davids</i> were built and operated by the Confederate
States navy, but the first of them was the only one to
accomplish anything.</p>

<p class="smaller">The Only Submarine to sink a Hostile Warship before the Outbreak of
the Present War.</p></div></div>

<p>The one real submarine possessed by the Confederacy
was not a <i>David</i>, though she is usually so called. This
was the C.S.S. <i>Hundley</i>, a hand-power “diving-boat”
not unlike Fulton’s <i>Nautilus</i>, but very much clumsier and
harder to manage. She had ballast tanks and a pair
of diving-planes for steering her up and down, and she
was designed to attack an enemy’s ship by swimming
under it, towing a torpedo that would explode on striking
her opponent’s keel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
The <i>Hundley</i> was built at Mobile, Alabama, by the
firm of Hundley and McKlintock, named for the senior
partner, and brought to Charleston on a flatcar. There
she was manned by a crew of nine volunteers, eight of
whom sat in a row and turned the cranks on the propellor-shaft,
while the ninth man steered. There was no
conning-tower and the forward hatchway had to be left
open for the helmsman to look out of while running on
the surface. On the <i>Hundley’s</i> first practice cruise, the
wash from the paddle-wheels of a passing steamer poured
suddenly down the open hatchway. Only the steersman
and commanding officer, Lieutenant Payne, had time to
save himself before the submarine sank, drowning the
rest of her crew.</p>

<p>The boat was raised and Payne took her out with a
new crew. This time a sudden squall sank her before
they could close the hatches, and Payne escaped, with two
of his men. He tried a third time, only to be capsized
off Fort Sumter, with the loss of four of his crew. On
the fourth trip, the hatches were closed, the tanks filled,
and an attempt was made to navigate beneath the surface.
But the <i>Hundley</i> dived too suddenly, stuck her nose deep
into the muddy bottom, and stayed there till her entire
crew were suffocated. On the fifth trial she became entangled
in the cable of an anchored vessel, with the same
result.</p>

<p>By this time the submarine’s victims numbered thirty-five,
and the Confederates had nicknamed her the “Peripatetic
Coffin.” But at the sixth call for volunteers, they
still came forward. It was decided to risk no more lives
on practice trips but to attack at once. In spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
protests of Mr. Hundley, the designer of the craft, her
latest and last commander, Lieutenant Dixon of the 21st
South Carolina Infantry, was ordered by General Beauregard
to use the vessel as a surface torpedo-boat, submerged
to the hatch-coaming and with the hatches open.
A spar-torpedo, to be exploded by pulling a trigger with
a light line running back into the boat, was mounted on the
bow. Thus armed, and manned by Lieutenant Dixon,
Captain Carlson, and five enlisted men of their regiment,
the little <i>Hundley</i> put out over Charleston bar on the
night of February 17, 1864, to attack some vessel of
the blockading fleet. This proved to be the U.S.S.
<i>Housatonic</i>, a fine new thirteen-gun corvette of 1264
tons. What followed is best described by Admiral
David Porter in his “Naval History of the Civil War.”</p>

<p>“At about 8.45 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, the officer of the deck on board
the unfortunate vessel discovered something about 100
yards away, moving along the water. It came directly
towards the ship, and within two minutes of the time it
was first sighted was alongside. The cable was slipped,
the engines backed, and all hands called to quarters. But
it was too late&mdash;the torpedo struck the <i>Housatonic</i> just
forward of the mainmast, on the starboard side, on a line
with the magazine. The man who steered her (the
<i>Hundley</i>) knew where the vital spots of the steamer were
and he did his work well. When the explosion took place
the ship trembled all over as if by the shock of an earthquake,
and seemed to be lifted out of the water, and then
sank stern-foremost, heeling to port as she went
down.”</p>

<p>The <i>Hundley</i> was not seen after the explosion, and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
was supposed that she had backed away and escaped.
But when peace came, and Charleston Harbor was being
cleared of the wrecks with which war had clogged it, the
divers sent down to inspect the <i>Housatonic</i> found the
<i>Hundley</i> lying beside her. Sucked in by the rush of the
water through the hole her torpedo had made, she had
been caught and dragged down by her own victim. All
the <i>Hundley’s</i> crew were found dead within her. So
perished the first and last submarine to sink a hostile warship,
before the outbreak of the present war. A smaller
underwater boat of the same type was privately built at
New Orleans at the beginning of the war, lost on her trial
trip, and not brought up again till after peace was declared.</p>

<p>The North had a hand-power submarine, that was built
at the Georgetown Navy Yard in 1862. It was designed
by a Frenchman, whose name is now forgotten but who
might have been a contemporary of Cornelius Van Drebel.
Except that its hull was of steel instead of wood and
greased leather, this first submarine of the United States
navy was no better than an eel-boat of the seventeenth
century. It was propelled by eight pairs of oars, with
hinged blades that folded up like a book on the return
stroke. The boat was thirty-five feet long and six in
diameter, and was rowed by sixteen men. It was submerged
by flooding ballast tanks. There was an oxygen
tank and an apparatus for purifying the used air by blowing
it over lime. A spar-torpedo was to be run out on
rollers in the bow.</p>

<p>Ten thousand dollars was paid to the inventor of this
medieval leftover, and he prudently left the country before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
he could be called on to operate it, though he had
been promised a reward of five thousand dollars for every
Confederate ironclad he succeeded in blowing up. Like
the first <i>Monitor</i>, this nameless submarine was lost in
a storm off Cape Hatteras, while being towed by a
steamer.</p>

<p>After the loss of the <i>Housatonic</i>, the North built two
semi-submersible steam torpedo-boats on the same idea
as the <i>David</i>, but larger and faster. Both were armed
with spar-torpedoes and fitted with ballast tanks to sink
them very low in the water when they attacked. The
smaller of the two, the <i>Stromboli</i>, could be submerged
till only her pilot-house, smoke-stack, and one ventilator
showed above the water. The other boat was called the
<i>Spuyten Duyvil</i>. She could be sunk till her deck, which
was covered with three inches of iron armor, was level
with the water, but she bristled with masts, funnels, conning-towers,
ventilators, and other excrescences that
sprouted out of her hull at the most unexpected places.
Neither of these craft was ever used in action.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WHITEHEAD TORPEDO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> best to float a charge of explosives against the
hull of an enemy’s ship and there explode it is the
great problem of torpedo warfare. The spar-torpedo,
that did such effective work in the Civil War, was little
more than a can of gunpowder on the end of a stick.
This stick or spar was mounted usually on the bow of a
steam-launch, either partially submerged, like the <i>David</i>,
or boldly running on the surface over log-booms and
through a hail of bullets and grapeshot, as when Lieutenant
Cushing sank the Confederate ironclad <i>Albemarle</i>.
Once alongside, the spar-torpedo was run out to its full
length, raised, depressed, and finally fired by pulling different
ropes. So small was the chance of success and so
great the danger to the launch’s crew that naval officers
and inventors all the world over sought constantly for
some surer and safer way.</p>

<p>Early in the sixties, an Austrian artillery officer attached
to the coast defenses conceived the idea of sending
out the launch without a crew. He made some drawings
of a big toy boat, to be driven by steam or hot air or even
by clockwork, and steered from the shore by long ropes.
As it would have no crew, this boat could carry the explosives
in its hull, and the spars which were to project
from it in all directions would carry no torpedoes themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
but would serve to explode the boat’s cargo of
guncotton by firing a pistol into it, as soon as one of the
spars came into contact with the target. Before he could
carry out his ideas any further, this officer died and his
plans were turned over to Captain Lupuis of the Austrian
navy. Lupuis experimented diligently with surface
torpedoes till 1864, but found that he would have to discover
some better steering-device than ropes from the
shore and some other motive-power than steam or clockwork.
So he consulted with Mr. Whitehead, the English
manager of a firm of engine manufacturers at the seaport
of Fiume.</p>

<p>Whitehead gave the torpedo a fish-shaped hull, so that
it could run beneath instead of on the surface. For motive-power
he used compressed air, which proved much
superior to either steam or clockwork. And by improving
its rudders, he enabled the little craft to keep its course
without the aid of guide-ropes from the shore. The chief
defect of the first Whitehead torpedoes, which were finished
and tried in 1866, was that they kept bobbing to the
surface, or else they would dive too deep and pass harmlessly
under the target. To correct this defect, Whitehead
invented by 1868 what he called the “balance chamber.”
Then, as now, each torpedo was divided into a
number of separate compartments or chambers, and in
one of these the inventor placed a most ingenious device
for keeping the torpedo at a uniform depth. The contents
of the balance-chamber was Whitehead’s great secret,
and it was not revealed to the public for twenty years.</p>

<p>The automobile or, as it was then called, the “submarine
locomotive” torpedo was now a practicable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
though by no means perfected, weapon, and the Austrian
naval authorities gave it a thorough trial at Fiume in
1868. Whitehead rigged up a crude ejecting tube on the
bow of a gunboat, and successfully discharged two of
his torpedoes at a yacht. The Austrian government
promptly adopted the weapon, but could not obtain a
monopoly of it, for Whitehead was a patriotic Englishman.
The British admiralty invited him to England two
years later, and after careful trials of its own, induced the
English government to buy Whitehead’s secret and manufacturing
rights for $45,000. Other nations soon added
“Whiteheads” to their navies, and in 1873 there was
built in Norway a large, fast steam launch for the express
purpose of carrying torpedoes and discharging them
at an enemy. Every one began to build larger and
swifter launches, till they evolved the torpedo-boat and
the destroyer of to-day.</p>

<p>The torpedo itself has undergone a similar development
in size and efficiency. The difference between the Whiteheads
of forty-five years ago and those of to-day is strikingly
shown in the following table:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
The length of a large modern torpedo, it will be observed,
is only three inches less than that of Fulton’s
famous submarine boat of 1801. A Whitehead torpedo
is really a small automatic submarine, steered and controlled
by the most ingenious and sensitive machinery,
as surely as if it were manned by a crew of Lilliputian
seamen.</p>

<p>Projecting from the head is the “striker,” a rod which,
when the torpedo runs into anything hard, is driven back
in against a detonator or “percussion-cap” of fulminate
of mercury. Just as the hammer of a toy “cap-pistol”
explodes a paper cap, so the sudden shock of the in-driven
striker explodes the fulminate, which is instantly expanded
to more than two thousand times its former size.
This, in turn, gives a severe blow to the surrounding
“primer” of dry guncotton. The primer is exploded,
and by its own expansion sets off the main charge of several
hundred pounds of wet guncotton.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that though wet guncotton is
safe to handle because a very great shock is required
to make it explode, dry guncotton is much less so, while a
shell or torpedo filled with fulminate of mercury would
be more dangerous to its owners than to their enemies,
because the slightest jar might set it off prematurely.
Every precaution is taken to prevent a torpedo’s exploding
too soon and damaging the vessel from which it
is fired.</p>

<p>When the torpedo is shot out of the tube, by compressed
air, like a pea from a pea-shooter, the striker is
held fast by the “jammer”: a small propellor-shaped
collar, whose blades begin to revolve as soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
strike the water, till the collar has unscrewed itself and
dropped off after the torpedo has traveled about forty
feet. A copper pin that runs through the striker-rod
is not removed but must be broken short off by a blow
of considerable violence, such as would be given by running
into a ship’s hull. As a third safeguard, there is a
strong safety-catch, that must be released by hand, just
before the torpedo is placed in the tube.</p>

<p>The explosive charge of two or three hundred pounds
of wet guncotton is called the “war-head.” In peace and
for target-practice it is replaced by a dummy head of
thick steel. The usual target is the space between two
buoys moored a ship’s length or less apart. At the end
of a practice run, the torpedo rises to the surface, where
it can be recovered and used again. This is distinctly
worth while, for a modern torpedo costs more than seven
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Back of the war-head is the air-chamber, that contains
the motive-power of this miniature submarine. The air
is either packed into it by powerful pumps, on shore
or shipboard, or else drawn from one of the storage
flasks of compressed air, a number of which are carried
on every submarine. The air-chamber of a modern
torpedo is charged at a pressure of from 2000 to 2500
pounds per square inch. As the torpedo leaves the tube,
a lever on its back is struck and knocked over by a
little projecting piece of metal, and the starting-valve
of the air-chamber is opened. But if the compressed air
were allowed to reach and start the engines at once, they
would begin to revolve the propellors while they were
still in the air inside the tube. This would cause the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
screws to “race,” or spin round too rapidly and perhaps
break off. So there is a “delaying-valve,” which keeps
the air away from the engines till another valve-lever is
swung over by the impact of the water against a little
metal flap.</p>

<p>As the compressed air rushes through the pipe from the
chamber to the engine-room, it passes through a “reducing-valve,”
which keeps it from spurting at the start
and lagging at the finish. By supplying the air to the
engines at a reduced but uniform pressure, this device
enables the torpedo to maintain the same speed throughout
the run. At the same time the compressed air is
heated by a small jet of burning oil, with a consequent
increase in pressure, power, and speed, estimated at 30
per cent. All these devices are kept not in the air-chamber
itself but in the next compartment, the balance-chamber.</p>

<p>Here is the famous little machine, once a close-kept
secret but now known to all the world, that holds the
torpedo at any desired depth. Think of a push-button,
working in a tube open to the sea, with the water pressure
pushing the button in and a spiral spring inside
shoving it out. This push-button&mdash;called a “hydrostatic
valve”&mdash;is connected by a system of levers with
the two diving-planes or horizontal rudders that steer
the torpedo up or down. By turning a screw, the spring
can be adjusted to exert a force equal to the pressure of
the water at any given depth. If the torpedo dives too
deep, the increased water-pressure forces in the valve,
moves the levers, raises the diving-planes, and steers the
torpedo towards the surface. As the water pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
grows less, the spring forces out the valve, depresses
the diving-planes, and brings the miniature submarine
down to its proper depth again. When his torpedoes
grew too big to be controlled by the comparatively feeble
force exerted by the hydrostatic valve, Whitehead invented
the “servo-motor”: an auxiliary, compressed-air
engine, less than five inches long, sensitive enough to
respond to the slightest movement of the valve levers but
strong enough to steer the largest torpedo, exactly as the
steam steering-gear moves the huge rudder of an ocean
liner.</p>

<p>There is also a heavy pendulum, swinging fore and aft
and attached to the diving-planes, that checks any sudden
up-or-down movement of the torpedo by inclining
the planes and restoring the horizontal position.</p>

<p>Next comes the engine-room, with its three-cylinder
motor, capable of developing from thirty-five to fifty-five
horse-power. The exhaust air from the engine passes
out through the stern in a constant stream of bubbles,
leaving a broad white streak on the surface of the water
as the torpedo speeds to its mark.</p>

<p>The aftermost compartment is called the buoyancy
chamber. Besides adding to the floatability of the torpedo,
this space also holds the engine shaft and the gear
attaching it to the twin propellors. The first Whiteheads
were single-screw boats. But the revolution of
the propellor in one direction set up a reaction that caused
the torpedo itself to partially revolve or heel over in the
other, disturbing its rudders and swerving it from its
course. This reaction is neutralized by using two propellers,
one revolving to the right, the other to the left.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Instead of being placed side by side, as on a steamer, they
are mounted one behind the other, with the shaft of one
revolving inside the hollow shaft of the other, and in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Long after they could be depended on to keep a proper
depth, the Whiteheads and other self-propelled torpedoes
were liable to swing suddenly to port or starboard, or
even turn completely round. During the war between
Chile and Peru, in 1879, the Peruvian ironclad <i>Huascar</i>
discharged an automobile torpedo that went halfway to
the target, changed its mind, and was coming back to blow
up its owners when an officer swam out to meet it and
succeeded in turning it aside, for the torpedoes of that
time were slow and small as well as erratic.</p>

<p>Nowadays a torpedo is kept on a straight course by a
gyroscope placed in the buoyancy chamber. Nearly
every boy knows the gyroscopic top, like a little flywheel,
that you can spin on the edge of a tumbler. The upper
part of this toy is a heavy little metal wheel, and if you
try to push it over while it is spinning, it resists and
pushes back, as if it were alive. A similar wheel, weighing
about two pounds, is placed in the buoyancy chamber
of a Whitehead. When the torpedo starts, it releases
either a powerful spring or an auxiliary compressed air
engine that sets the gyroscope to spinning at more than
two thousand revolutions a minute. It revolves vertically,
in the fore-and-aft line of the torpedo, and is
mounted on a pivoted stand. If the torpedo deviates
from its straight course, the gyroscope does not, and the
consequent change in their relative positions brings the
flywheel into contact with a lever running to the servo-motor
that controls the two vertical rudders, which soon
set the torpedo right again.</p>

Thus guided and driven, a modern torpedo speeds
swiftly and surely to its target, there to blow itself into
a thousand pieces, with a force sufficient to sink a ship
a thousand times its size.</p>

<p>The Whitehead is used by every navy in the world
except the German, which has its own torpedo: the
“Schwartzkopf.” This, however, is practically identical
with the Whitehead, except that its hull is made of bronze
instead of steel and its war-head is charged with trinitrotuluol,
or T.N.T., a much more powerful explosive
than guncotton.</p>

<p>After the Russo-Japanese War, when several Russian
battleships kept afloat although they had been struck by
Japanese torpedoes, many naval experts declared that an
exploding war-head spent most of its energy in throwing
a great column of water up into the air, instead of blowing
in the side of the ship. So Commander Davis of the
United States navy invented his “gun-torpedo.” This
is like a Whitehead in every respect except that instead
of a charge of guncotton it carries in its head a short
eight-inch cannon loaded with an armor-piercing shell
and a small charge of powder. In this type of torpedo,
the impact of the striker against the target serves to fire
the gun. The shell then passes easily through the thin
side of the ship below the armor-belt and through any
protecting coal-bunkers and bulkheads it may encounter,
till it reaches the ship’s vitals, where it is exploded by the
delayed action of an adjustable time-fuse. What would
happen if it burst in a magazine or boiler-room is best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
left to the imagination. Several Davis gun-torpedoes
have been built and used against targets with very satisfactory
results, but they have not yet been used in actual
warfare.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward F. Chandler, M.E., one of the foremost
torpedo-experts in America, is dissatisfied with the compressed-air
driven gyroscope, both because it does not
begin to revolve till after the torpedo has been launched
and perhaps deflected from its true course, and because
it cannot be made to spin continuously throughout the
long run of a modern torpedo. He proposes to remove
the compressed-air servo-motors, both for this purpose
and for controlling the horizontal rudders by the hydrostatic
valve, and replace them with an electrical-driven
gyroscope and depth-gear. The increased efficiency of
the latter would enable him to get rid of the heavy, uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
pendulum, thus allowing for the weight of the
storage batteries. Mr. Chandler declares that his electrically-controlled
torpedo can be lowered over the side
of a small boat, headed in any desired direction, and
started, without any launching-tube.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

  <div class="caption">Effect of Davis Gun-Torpedo on a specially-constructed target.</div></div>

<p>Though the automobile torpedo has been brought to so
high a state of perfection, the original idea of steering
from the shore has not been abandoned. The Brennan
and Sims-Edison controllable torpedoes were driven and
steered by electricity, receiving the current through wires
trailed astern and carrying little masts and flags above the
surface to guide the operator on shore. But these also
served as a warning to the enemy and gave him too good
a chance either to avoid the torpedo or destroy it with
machine-gun fire. Then, too, the trailing wires reduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
its speed and were always liable to get tangled in the
propellors. Controllable torpedoes of this type were
abandoned before the outbreak of the present war and
will probably never be used in action.</p>

<p>A new and more promising sort of controllable torpedo
was immediately suggested by the invention of wireless
telegraphy. Many inventors have been working to perfect
such a weapon, and a young American engineer, Mr.
John Hays Hammond, Jr., seems to have succeeded.
From his wireless station on shore, Mr. Hammond can
make a small, crewless electric launch run hither and yon
as he pleases about the harbor of Gloucester, Massachusetts.
The commander and many of the officers of the
United States coast artillery corps have carefully inspected
and tested this craft, which promises to be the
forerunner of a new and most formidable species of
coast defense torpedo.</p>

<span class="subhead">FREAKS AND FAILURES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">During</span> the half-century following the death of Fulton,
scarcely a year went by without the designing
or launching of a new man-power submarine. Some of
these boats, notably those of the Bavarian Wilhelm Bauer,
were surprisingly good, others were most amazingly bad,
but none of them led to anything better. Inventor after
inventor wasted his substance discovering what Van
Drebel, Bushnell, and Fulton had known before him,
only to die and have the same facts painfully rediscovered
by some one on the other side of the earth.</p>

<p>A striking example of this lack of progress is Halstead’s
<i>Intelligent Whale</i>. Built for the United States
navy at New York, in the winter of 1864&ndash;5, this craft is
no more modern and much less efficient than Fulton’s
<i>Nautilus</i> of 1801. The <i>Intelligent Whale</i> is a fat, cigar-shaped,
iron vessel propelled by a screw cranked by manpower
and submerged by dropping two heavy anchors to
the bottom and then warping the boat down to any desired
depth. A diver can then emerge from a door in the
submarine’s bottom, to place a mine under a hostile ship.
It was not until 1872 that the <i>Intelligent Whale</i> was sent
on a trial trip in Newark Bay. Manned by an utterly inexperienced
and very nervous crew, the clumsy submarine
got entirely out of control and had to be hauled up by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
cable that had been thoughtfully attached to her before
she went down. Fortunately no lives had been lost,
but the wildest stories were told and printed, till the
imaginary death-roll ran up to forty-nine. The <i>Intelligent
Whale</i> was hauled up on dry land and can still
be seen on exhibition at the corner of Third Street and
Perry Avenue in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>

<p>Lack of motive-power was the reason why man-sized
submarines lagged behind their little automatic brethren,
the Whitehead torpedoes. Compressed air was just the
thing for a spurt, but when two Frenchmen, Captain
Bourgois and M. Brun, built the <i>Plongeur</i>, a steel submarine
146 feet long and 12 feet in diameter, at Rochefort
in 1863, and fitted it with an eighty-horse-power,
compressed-air engine, they discovered that the storage-flasks
emptied themselves too quickly to permit a voyage
of any length.</p>

<p>The <i>Plongeur</i> also proved that while you can sink a
boat to the bottom by filling her ballast-tanks or make
her rise to the surface by emptying them, you cannot
make her float suspended between two bodies of water
except by holding her there by some mechanical means.
Without anything of the kind, the <i>Plongeur</i> kept bouncing
up and down like a rubber ball. Once her inventors navigated
her horizontally for some distance, only to find
that she had been sliding on her stomach along the soft
muddy bottom of a canal. Better results were obtained
after the <i>Plongeur</i> was fitted with a crude pair of diving-planes.
But the inefficiency of her compressed-air engine
caused her to be condemned and turned into a water
tank.</p>

Electricity was first applied in 1861 by another Frenchman,
named Olivier Riou. This is the ideal motive-power
for underwater boats, and it was at this time that
Jules Verne described the ideal submarine in his immortal
story of “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.”
But before we can have a <i>Nautilus</i> like Captain Nemo’s
we must discover an electric storage battery of unheard-of
lightness and capacity.</p>

<p>There was a great revival of French interest in electric
submarines after Admiral Aube, who was a lifelong
submarine “fan,” became minister of marine in 1886.
In spite of much ridicule and opposition, he authorized
the construction of a small experimental vessel of this
type called the <i>Gymnote</i>. She was a wild little thing
that did everything short of turning somersaults when she
dived, but she was enough of a success to be followed by
a larger craft named, after the great engineer who had
designed her predecessor, the <i>Gustave Zédé</i>.</p>

<p>“The history of the <i>Gustave Zédé</i> shows how much
in earnest the French were in the matter of submarines.
When she was first launched she was a failure in almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
every respect, and it was only after some years, during
which many alterations and improvements were carried
out, that she became a serviceable craft. At first nothing
would induce the <i>Gustave Zédé</i> to quit the surface,
and when at last she did plunge she did it so effectually
that she went down to the bottom in 10 fathoms of water
at an angle of 30 degrees. The committee of engineers
were on board at the time, and it speaks well for their
patriotism that they did not as a result of their unpleasant
experience condemn the <i>Gustave Zédé</i> and advise the
government to spend no more money on submarine
craft.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Twenty-nine other electric submarines were built for
the French navy between 1886 and 1901. During the
same period, a French gentleman named M. Goubet
built and experimented with two very small electric submarines,
each of which was manned by two men, who sat
back to back on a sort of settee stuffed with machinery.
Little or big, all these French boats had the same fatal
defect: lack of power. Their storage batteries, called on
to propel them above, as well as below, the surface, became
exhausted after a few hours’ cruising. They were
as useless for practical naval warfare as an electric run-about
would be to haul guns or carry supplies in Flanders.</p>

<p>But if compressed-air and electricity were too quickly
exhausted, gasoline or petroleum was even less practicable
for submarine navigation. To set an oil-engine, that
derives its power from the explosion of a mixture of
oil-vapor and air, at work in a small closed space like the
interior of a submarine, would soon make it uninhabitable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
While Mr. Holland was puzzling how to overcome
this difficulty, in the middle eighties, a Swedish inventor
named Nordenfeldt was building submarines to be run by
steam-power.</p>

<p>Mr. Nordenfeldt, who is remembered to-day as the inventor
of the famous gun that bears his name, had taken
up the idea of an English clergyman named Garett, who
in 1878 had built a submarine called the <i>Resurgam</i>, or
“I Shall Rise.” Garett’s second boat, built a year later,
had a steam-engine. When the vessel was submerged,
the smoke-stack was closed by a sliding panel, the furnace
doors were shut tight, and the engine run by the steam
given off by a big tank full of bottled-up hot water.
Nordenfeldt improved this system till his hot-water tanks
gave off enough steam to propel his boat beneath the surface
for a distance of fourteen miles.</p>

<p>He also rediscovered and patented Bushnell’s device
for submerging a boat by pushing it straight down and
holding it under with a vertical propellor. His first submarine
had two of these, placed in sponsons or projections
on either side of the center of the hull. The Nordenfeldt
boats, with their cigar-shaped hulls and projecting
smoke-stacks, looked like larger editions of the
Civil War <i>Davids</i>, and like them, could be submerged by
taking in water-ballast till only a strip of deck with the
funnel and conning-tower projected above the surface.
Then the vertical propellors would begin to revolve and
force the boat straight down on an even keel. Mr. Nordenfeldt
insisted with great earnestness that this was the
only safe and proper way to submerge a submarine. If
you tried to steer it downward with any kind of driving-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>planes,
he declared, then the boat was liable to keep on
descending, before you could pull its head up, till it either
struck the bottom or was crushed in by the pressure of
too great a depth of water. There was a great deal of
truth in this, but Mr. Nordenfeldt failed to realize that
if one of his vertical propellors pushed only a little harder
than the other, then the keel of his own submarine was
going to be anything but even.</p>

<p>The first Nordenfeldt boat was launched in 1886 and
bought by Greece, after a fairly successful trial in the
Bay of Salamis. Two larger and more powerful submarines:
<i>Nordenfeldt II</i> and <i>III</i>, were promptly ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
by Greece’s naval rival Turkey. Each of these was 125
feet long, or nearly twice the length of the Greek boat,
and each carried its two vertical propellors on deck, one
forward and the other aft. Both boats were shipped in
sections to Constantinople in 1887, but only <i>Nordenfeldt
II</i> was put together and tried. She was one of the
first submarines to be armed with a bow torpedo-tube for
discharging Whiteheads, and as a surface torpedo-boat,
she was a distinct success. But when they tried to navigate
her under water there was a circus.</p>

<p>No sooner did one of the crew take two steps forward
in the engine-room than down went the bow. The hot
water in the boilers and the cold water in the ballast-tanks
ran downhill, increasing the slant still further.
English engineers, Turkish sailors, monkey-wrenches, hot
ashes, Whitehead torpedoes, and other movables came
tumbling after, till the submarine was nearly standing
on her head, with everything inside packed into the bow
like toys in the toe of a Christmas stocking. The little
vertical propellors pushed and pulled and the crew clawed
their way aft, till suddenly up came her head, down went
her tail, and everything went gurgling and clattering
down to the other end. <i>Nordenfeldt II</i> was a perpetual
see-saw, and no mortal power could keep her on an even
keel. Once they succeeded in steadying her long enough
to fire a torpedo. Where it went to, no man can tell,
but the sudden lightening of the bow and the recoil of
the discharge made the submarine rear up and sit down
so hard that she began to sink stern-foremost. The
water was blown out of her ballast tanks by steam-pressure,
and the main engine started full speed ahead, till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
she shot up to the surface like a flying-fish. The Turkish
naval authorities, watching the trials from the shores of
the Golden Horn, were so impressed by these antics that
they bought the boat. But it was impossible to keep a
crew on her, for every native engineer or seaman who
was sent on board prudently deserted on the first dark
night. So the <i>Nordenfeldt II</i> rusted away till she fell
to pieces, long before the Allied fleets began the forcing
of the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>Fantastic though their performances seem to us to-day,
these submarines represent the best work of some of
the most capable inventors and naval engineers of the
nineteenth century. With them deserve to be mentioned
the boats of the Russian Drzewiecki and the Spaniard
Peral. Failures though they were, they taught the world
many valuable lessons about the laws controlling the actions
of submerged bodies.</p>

<p>But many of the underwater craft invented between
1850 and 1900 can be classified only as freaks. Most of
them, fortunately, were designed but never built, and
those that were launched miraculously refrained from
drowning any of their crews. There were submarines
armed with steam-driven gimlets: the</p>

<p class="in0">that Ben Jonson playfully ascribed to Van Drebel. Dr.
Lacomme, in 1869, proposed a submarine railroad from
Calais to Dover, with tracks laid on the bottom of the
Channel and cars that could cast off their wheels and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
rise to the surface in case of accident. Lieutenant André
Constantin designed, during the siege of Paris, a boat to
be submerged by drawing in pistons working in large
cylinders open to the water. A vessel was actually built
on this principle in England in 1888, and submerged in
Tilbury Docks, where the soft mud at the bottom choked
the cylinders so that the pistons could not be driven out
again and the boat was brought up with considerable difficulty.
Two particularly delirious inventors claimed
that their submarines could also be used as dirigible balloons.
Boucher’s underwater boat of 1886 was to have
gills like a fish, so that it need never rise to the surface
for air, and was further adorned with spring-buffers on
the bottom, oars, a propellor under the center of the
keel, and a movable tail for sculling the vessel forward.
There were submarines with paddle-wheels, submarines
with fins, and submarines with wings. A Venezuelan
dentist, Señor Lacavalerier, invented a double-hulled,
cigar-shaped boat, whose outer hull was threaded like
a screw, and by revolving round the fixed inner hull,
bored its way through the water. But he had been anticipated
and outdone by Apostoloff, a Russian, who not
only designed a submarine on the same principle but intended
it to carry a large cabin suspended on davits above
the surface of the water, and declared that his vessel
would cross the Atlantic at an average speed of 111
knots an hour.</p>

<p>As late as 1898 the Spanish government, neglecting
the promising little electric boat built ten years before
by Señor Peral, was experimenting with two highly
impossible submarines, one of which was to be propelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
by a huge clock-spring, while the other was perfectly
round. Needless to say, neither the sphere nor the toy
boat ever encountered the American fleet.</p>

<p>At the same time, the United States government declined
to accept the war services of the already practicable
boats of the two American inventors who were
about to usher in the present era of submarine warfare:
Simon Lake and John P. Holland.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the <i>Merrimac</i> rammed the <i>Cumberland</i>,
burned the <i>Congress</i>, and was fought to a standstill
next day by the little <i>Monitor</i>, all the world realized
that there had been a revolution in naval warfare. The
age of the wooden warship was gone forever, the day
of the ironclad had come. And a twenty-year-old Irish
school-teacher began to wonder what would be the next
revolution; what new craft might be invented that would
dethrone the ironclad. This young Irishman’s name was
John P. Holland, and he decided to devote his life to the
perfection of the submarine.</p>

<p>Like Robert Fulton, Admiral Von Tirpitz, and the
Frenchman who built the <i>Rotterdam Boat</i> in 1652, Holland
relied on submarines to break the power of the
British fleet. Though born a British subject, in the little
village of Liscannor, County Clare in the year 1842, he
had seen too many of his fellow countrymen starved to
death or driven into exile not to hate the stupid tyranny
that characterized England’s rule of Ireland in those bitter,
far-off days. He longed for the day of Ireland’s independence,
and that day seemed to be brought much
nearer by the American Civil War. Not only had many
thousand brave Irish-Americans become trained veterans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
but Great Britain and the United States had been brought
to the verge of war by the sinking of American ships
by the <i>Alabama</i> and other British-built, Confederate
commerce-destroyers. When that Anglo-American war
broke out, there would be an army ready to come over and
free Ireland&mdash;if only the troublesome British navy could
be put out of the way. And already the English were
launching ironclad after ironclad to replace their now
useless steam-frigates and ships-of-the-line. It is no use
trying to outbuild or outfight the British navy above
water, and John P. Holland realized this in 1862, as several
kings and emperors have, before or since.</p>

<p class="smaller">Drawn by Lieutenant F. M. Barber, U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;N., in 1875.</p></div></div>

<p>Though his friends in Cork kept laughing at him, Holland
worked steadily on his plans for a submarine boat,
throughout the sixties. Presently he came to America
and obtained a job as school-teacher in Paterson, New
Jersey. There he built and launched his first submarine
in 1875. It was a sharp-pointed, little, cigar-shaped affair,
only sixteen feet long and two feet in diameter
amidships. This craft was designed to carry a torpedo
and fix it to the bottom of a ship, on the general principle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of Bushnell’s <i>Turtle</i>. It was divided into four compartments,
with air-chambers fore and aft. Air-pipes led
to where Holland sat in the middle, with his head in a
respirator shaped like a diver’s helmet, and his feet working
pedals that turned the propellor.</p>

<p>There was nothing revolutionary about this <i>Holland
No. 1</i>. A similar underwater bicycle is said to have
been invented by Alvary Templo in 1826, and Drzewiecki
used one at Odessa in 1877. But Holland used his to
teach himself how to build something better. Just as
the Wright brothers learned how to build and fly aeroplanes
by coasting down through the air from the tops
of the Kitty Hawk sand-hills in their motorless “glider,”
so John P. Holland found how to make and navigate
submarines by diving under the surface of the Passaic
River and adjacent waters, and swimming around there
in his <i>No. 1</i> and her successors.</p>

<p>The <i>Holland No. 2</i> was launched in 1877 and became
immediately and prophetically stuck in the mud. She
had a double hull, the space between being used as a ballast-tank,
whose contents leaked constantly into the interior,
and she was driven intermittently by a four horse-power
petroleum engine of primitive design. After a
series of trials that entertained his neighbors and taught
the inventor that the best place for a single horizontal
rudder is the stern, Holland took the engine out of the
boat and sank her under the Falls Bridge, where she lies
to this day.</p>

<p>He then entered into negotiations with the Fenian
Brotherhood, a secret society organized for the purpose
of setting up an Irish republic by militant methods.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Though not a Fenian himself, Holland was thoroughly
in sympathy with the brotherhood, and offered to show
them how they could get round, or rather under, the
British navy. You may have seen a once-familiar lithograph
of a green-painted superdreadnought of strange
design flying the Crownless Harp, and named the Irish
battleship <i>Emerald Isle</i>. The only real Irish warships
of modern times, however, were the two submarines Holland
persuaded the Fenians to have him build at their
expense.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Philip Hichborn, former Chief Constructor,
U.S.N., said of these two boats:</p>

<p>“She (the earlier one) was the first submarine since
Bushnell’s time employing water ballast and always retaining
buoyancy, in which provision was made to insure
a fixed center of gravity and a fixed absolute weight.
Moreover, she was the first buoyant submarine to be
steered down and up in the vertical plane by horizontal-rudder
action as she was pushed forward by her motor,
instead of being pushed up and down by vertical-acting
mechanism.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Her petroleum engine, provided for motive-power
and for charging her compressed-air flasks,
was inefficient, and the boat therefore failed as a practical
craft; but in her were demonstrated all the chief
principles of successful, brain-directed, submarine navigation.
In 1881, Holland turned out a larger and better
boat in which he led the world far and away in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
solution of submarine problems, and for a couple of years
demonstrated that he could perfectly control his craft in
the vertical plane. Eventually, through financial complications,
she was taken to New Haven, where she now
is.”</p>

  <span class="smaller">(Photographed by Mr. Simon Lake, in the shed at New Haven.)</span></p></div></div>

<p>Political as well as financial complications caused the
internment of this submarine, which a New York reporter,
with picturesque inaccuracy, called the <i>Fenian
Ram</i>. The Irish at home were by this time thinking less
of fighting for independence and more for peacefully
obtaining home rule, while the arbitration and payment
of the “Alabama claims” by Great Britain had removed
all danger of a war between that country and the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
States. Under these circumstances, many of the Fenians
felt that it was wasted money for their society to spend
any more of its funds on warships it could never find use
for. This led to dissensions which culminated in a party
of Fenians seizing the <i>Ram</i> and taking it to a shed on
the premises of one of their members at New Haven,
where it has remained ever since.</p>

<p>But the construction and performances of this submarine,
and of several others which he soon afterwards
built for himself, won Holland such a reputation that
when Secretary Whitney decided in 1888 that submarines
would be a good thing for the United States navy, the
great Philadelphia ship-building firm of Cramps submitted
two designs: Holland’s and Nordenfeldt’s, and
the former won the award. But after nearly twelve
months had been spent in settling preliminary details, and
when a contract for building an experimental boat was
just about to be awarded, there came a change of administration
and the matter was dropped.</p>

<p>This was a great disappointment for Holland, and the
next four or five years were lean ones for the inventor.
He had built five boats and designed a sixth without their
having brought him a cent of profit. It was not until
March 3, 1893, that Congress appropriated the money
for the construction of an experimental submarine, and
inventors were invited to submit their designs. By this
time John P. Holland had not only spent all his own
money, but all he could borrow from his relatives and
friends. To make matters worse, the country was then
passing through a financial panic, when very few people
had any money to lend or invest. And all the security<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Holland could offer was his faith in the future of the
submarine, which at that time was a stock joke of the
comic papers, together with those other two crack-brained
projects, the flying-machine and the horseless carriage.</p>

<p>“I know I can win that competition and build that
boat for the Government,” said Holland to a young lawyer
whom he had met at lunch in a downtown New
York restaurant, “if I can only raise the money to pay
the fees and other expenses. I need exactly $347.19.”</p>

<p>“What do you want the nineteen cents for?” asked
the other.</p>

<p>“To buy a certain kind of ruler I need for drawing my
plans.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve figured it out as closely as all that,” replied
the lawyer, “I’ll take a chance and lend you the
money.”</p>

<p>He did so, receiving in exchange a large block of stock
in the new-formed Holland Torpedo-boat Company.
To-day his stock is worth several million dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Holland won the competition and after two years’
delay his company began the construction of the <i>Plunger</i>.
This submarine was to be propelled by steam while running
on the surface and by storage-batteries when submerged.
Double propulsion of this type had been first
installed by a Southerner named Alstitt on a submarine
he built at Mobile, Alabama, in 1863, and theoretically
discussed in a book written in 1887 by Commander
Hovgaard of the Danish navy. Though a great improvement
on any type of single propulsion, this system
had many drawbacks, the chief of which was the length
of time&mdash;from fifteen to thirty minutes&mdash;that it took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
for the oil-burning surface engine to cool and rid itself
of hot gases before it was safe to seal the funnel and
dive. Though the <i>Plunger</i> was launched in 1897, she
was never finished, for Mr. Holland foresaw her defects.
He persuaded the Government to let his company pay
back the money already spent on the <i>Plunger</i> and build
an entirely new boat.</p>

<p><i>Holland No. 8</i> was built accordingly, but failed to work
properly. Finally came the ninth and last of her line,
the first of the modern submarines, the world-famous
<i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p>She was a chunky little porpoise of a boat, 10 feet
7 inches deep and only 53 feet 10 inches long, and looking
even shorter and thicker than she was because of
the narrow, comb-like superstructure running fore and
aft along the deck. But her shape and dimensions were
the results of twenty-five years’ experience. Built at
Mr. Lewis Nixon’s shipyards at Elizabethport, New Jersey,
the <i>Holland</i> was launched in the early spring of 1898,
between the blowing-up of the <i>Maine</i> and the outbreak
of the Spanish-American War. But though John P.
Holland repeatedly begged to be allowed to take his submarine
into Santiago Harbor and torpedo Cervera’s fleet,
the naval authorities at Washington were too conservative-minded
to let him try.</p>

<p>“United States warship goes down with all hands!”
the small boys (I was one of them) used to shout at
this time, and then explain that it was only another dive
of the “Holland submarine.” Strictly speaking, the
<i>Holland</i> was not a United States warship till October
13, 1900, when she was formally placed in commission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
under the command of Lieutenant Harry H. Caldwell,
who had been on her during many of the exhaustive series
of trials in which the little undersea destroyer proved to
even the most conservative officers of our navy that the
day of the submarine had come at last.</p>

  <div class="caption">U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. <i>Holland</i>, in Drydock with the Russian Battleship <i>Retvizan</i>.</div></div>

<p>Propelled on the surface by a fifty horse-power gasoline
motor, the <i>Holland</i> had a cruising radius of 1500
miles at a speed of seven knots an hour. Submerged,
she was driven by electric storage-batteries. This effective
combination of oil-engines with an electric motor is
one of John P. Holland’s great discoveries, and is used
in every submarine to-day. When her tanks were filled
till her deck was flush with the water, and the two horizontal
rudders at the stern began to steer her downwards,
the <i>Holland</i> could dive to a depth of twenty-eight
feet in five seconds. She had no periscope, for that instrument
was then crude and unsatisfactory. To take
aim, the captain of the <i>Holland</i> had to make a quick
“porpoise dive,” up to the surface and down again, exposing
the conning-tower for the few seconds needed to
take aim and judge the distance to the target. Though
by this means the <i>Holland</i> succeeded in getting within
striking-distance of the <i>Kearsarge</i> and the <i>New York</i>
without being detected, during the summer manœuvers
of the Atlantic fleet off Newport in 1900, it has proved
fatal to the only submarine that has tried it in actual
warfare (see page <a href="#Page_160">160</a>).</p>

<p>Less than half the length of the <i>Nordenfeldt II</i>, the
<i>Holland</i> did not pitch or see-saw when submerged.
Each of her crew of six sat on a low stool beside the
machinery he was to operate, and there was no moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
about when below the surface. Neither did the boat
stand on her tail when a torpedo was discharged from
the bow-tube, for the loss of weight was immediately
compensated by admitting an equivalent amount of water
into a tank. Originally the <i>Holland</i> had a stern torpedo-tube
as well, besides a pneumatic gun for throwing eighty
pounds of dynamite half a mile through the air, but these
were later removed.</p>

<p>How the <i>Holland</i> impressed our naval officers at that
time is best shown in the oft-quoted testimony of Admiral
Dewey before the naval committee of the House of
Representatives in 1900.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I saw the operation of the boat down off
Mount Vernon the other day. Several members of this
committee were there. I think we were all very much
impressed with its performance. My aid, Lieutenant
Caldwell, was on board. The boat did everything that
the owners proposed to do. I said then, and I have said
it since, that if they had had two of those things at
Manila, I could never have held it with the squadron I
had. The moral effect&mdash;to my mind, it is infinitely superior
to mines or torpedoes or anything of the kind.
With those craft moving under water it would wear
people out. With two of those in Galveston all the navies
of the world could not blockade the place.”</p>

<p>The <i>Holland</i> was purchased by the United States Government
on April 11, 1900, for $150,000. She had cost
her builders, exclusive of any office expenses or salaries
of officers, $236,615.43. But it had been a profitable investment
for the Holland Torpedo-boat Company, for
on August 25, the United States navy contracted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
it for the construction of six more submarines. And in
the autumn of the same year, though it was not announced
to the public till March 1, 1901, five other
<i>Hollands</i> were ordered through the agency of Vickers
Sons, and Maxim by the British admiralty. Soon every
maritime nation was either buying <i>Hollands</i> or paying
royalties on the inventor’s patents, and building bigger,
faster, better submarines every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
The original <i>Holland</i> had outlived her fighting value
when she was condemned by Secretary Daniels in June,
1915, to be broken up and sold as junk. There is still
room in the Brooklyn Navy Yard for that worthless
and meaningless relic, the <i>Intelligent Whale</i>, but there
was none for the <i>Holland</i> submarine, whose place in history
is with the <i>Clairmont</i> and the <i>Monitor</i>.</p>

<p>John P. Holland withdrew in 1904 from the Holland
Torpedo-boat Company, which has since become merged
with the Electric Boat Company, that builds most of the
submarines for the United States navy, and many for
the navies of foreign powers. Like most other great
inventive geniuses, Holland was not a trained engineer,
and it was perhaps inevitable that disputes should have
arisen between him and his associates as to the carrying
out of his ideas. His last years were embittered by the
belief that the submarines of to-day were distorted and
worthless developments of his original type. Whether
or not he was mistaken, only time can tell. That to
John P. Holland, more than to any other man since
David Bushnell and Robert Fulton, the world owes the
modern submarine, cannot be denied. His death, on
August 12, 1914, was but little noticed in the turmoil
and confusion of the first weeks of the great European
War. But when the naval histories of that war are
written, his name will not be forgotten.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAKE SUBMARINES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">John P. Holland</span> was not the only inventor who
responded to the invitation of the United States navy
department to submit designs for a proposed submarine
boat in 1893. That invitation had been issued and an
appropriation of $200,000 made by Congress on the
recommendation of Commander Folger, chief of ordnance,
after he had seen a trial trip on Lake Michigan
of an underwater boat invented by Mr. George C. Baker.
This was an egg-shaped craft, propelled by a steam engine
on the surface and storage-batteries when submerged,
and controlled by two adjustable propellers,
mounted on either side of the boat on a shaft running
athwartship. These screws could be turned in any direction,
so as to push or pull the vessel forward, downward,
or at any desired angle. Mr. Baker submitted designs
for a larger boat of the same kind, but they were not
accepted.</p>

<p>The third inventor who entered the 1893 competition
was Mr. Simon Lake, then a resident of Baltimore. He
sent in the plans of the most astonishing-looking craft
that had startled the eyes of the navy department since
Ericsson’s original monitor. It had two cigar-shaped
hulls, one inside the other, the space between being used
for ballast-tanks. It had no less than five propellors:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
twin screws aft for propulsion, a single screw working
in an open transverse tunnel forward,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> to “swing the
vessel at rest to facilitate pointing her torpedos,” and two
downhaul or vertical-acting propellers “for holding vessel
to depth when not under way.” These were not placed
on deck, as on the <i>Nordenfeldt II</i>, but in slots in the
keel. Other features of the bottom were two anchor
weights, a detachable “emergency keel,” and a diving
compartment. On deck were a folding periscope and
a “gun arranged in water-tight, revolving turret for defense
purposes or attack on unarmored surface craft.”
There were four torpedo tubes, two forward and two aft,
according to the modern German practice. The motive-power
was the then usual combination of steam and storage
batteries. But the two remaining features of the
1893 model Lake submarine were extremely unusual.</p>

<p>Instead of one pair of horizontal rudders, there were
four pairs, two large and two small. The latter, placed
near the bow and stern, were “levelling vanes, designed
automatically to hold the vessel on a level keel when under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
way”; while the larger ones were called “hydroplanes”
and so located and designed as to steer the submarine
under, not by making it dive bow-foremost but by causing
it to submerge on an even keel. How this was to be
accomplished will be explained presently. The other new
thing about the Lake boat was that it was mounted on
wheels for running along the sea-bottom. There were
three of these wheels: a large pair forward on a strong
axle for bearing the vessel’s weight, and a small steering-wheel
on the bottom of the rudder.</p>

  <div class="caption">The <i>Argonaut Junior</i>.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
This submarine was never built, however, for the
congressional appropriation was awarded to the Holland
Torpedo-boat Company and Mr. Lake had at that time
no means for building so elaborate a vessel by himself.
What he did build was the simplest and crudest little
submarine imaginable: the <i>Argonaut Jr.</i> She was a
triangular box of yellow pine, fourteen feet long and five
feet deep, mounted on three solid wooden wheels. She
was trundled along the bottom of Sandy Hook Bay by
one or two men cranking the axle of the two driving
wheels. The boat was provided with an air-lock and
diver’s compartment “so arranged that by putting an
air pressure on the diver’s compartment equal to the water
pressure outside, a bottom door could be opened and no
water would come into the vessel. Then by putting on
a pair of rubber boots the operator could walk around
on the sea bottom and push the boat along with him and
pick up objects, such as clams, oysters, etc., from the
sea bottom.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Enough people were convinced by the performances
of this simple craft of the soundness of Mr. Lake’s theories
that the inventor was able to raise sufficient capital
to build a larger submarine. This boat, which was designed
in 1895 and built at Baltimore in 1897, was called
the <i>Argonaut</i>. When launched, she had a cigar-shaped
hull thirty-six feet long by nine in diameter, mounted on
a pair of large toothed driving-wheels forward and a
guiding-wheel on the rudder. The driving-wheels could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
be disconnected and left to revolve freely while the boat
was driven by its single-screw propeller. There was a
diver’s compartment in the bottom and a “lookout compartment
in the extreme bow, with a powerful searchlight
to light up a pathway in front of her as she moved along
over the waterbed. The searchlight I later found of
little value except for night work in clear water. In clear
water the sunlight would permit of as good vision without
the use of the light as with it, while if the water was
not clear, no amount of light would permit of vision
through it for any considerable distance.”</p>

<p>Storage batteries were carried only for working the
searchlight and illuminating the interior of the boat. The
<i>Argonaut</i> was propelled, both above and below the surface,
by a thirty horse-power gasoline engine, the first
one to be installed in a submarine. There was enough
air to run it on, even when submerged, because the
<i>Argonaut</i> was ventilated through a hose running to a float
on the surface: a device later changed to two pipe masts
long enough to let her run along the bottom at a depth
of fifty feet.</p>

<div id="ip_87" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <div class="captionl">Courtesy of International Marine Engineering.</div>
  <div class="caption"><i>Argonaut</i> as Originally Built.</div></div>

<p>The <i>Argonaut</i> had no hydroplanes or horizontal rudders
of any kind. She was submerged, like the <i>Intelligent
Whale</i>, by “two anchor weights, each weighing 1000
pounds, attached to cables, and capable of being hauled up
or lowered by a drum and mechanism within the boat....
When it is desired to submerge the vessel the anchor
weights are first lowered to the bottom; water is then
allowed to enter the water-ballast compartments until her
buoyancy is less than the weight of the two anchors, say
1500 pounds; the cables connecting with the weights are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
then hauled in, and the vessel is thus hauled to the bottom,
until she comes to rest on her three wheels. The
weights are then hauled into their pockets in the keel, and
it is evident that she is resting on the wheels with a weight
equal to the difference between her buoyancy with the
weights at the bottom, and the weights in their pockets,
or 500 pounds. Now this weight may be increased or
diminished, either by admitting more water into the ballast
tanks or by pumping some out. Thus it will be seen
that we have perfect control of the vessel in submerging
her, as we may haul her down as fast or as slow as we
please, and by having her rest on the bottom with sufficient
weight to prevent the currents from moving her out of her
course we may start up our propeller or driving-wheels
and drive her at will over the bottom, the same as a tricycle
is propelled on the surface of the earth in the upper air.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
In muddy bottoms, we rest with a weight not much over
100 pounds; while on hard bottoms, or where there are
strong currents, we sometimes rest on the bottom with
a weight of from 1000 to 1500 pounds....</p>

<p>“In the rivers we invariably found a muddy bed; in
Chesapeake Bay we found bottoms of various kinds,
in some places so soft that our divers would sink up to
their knees, while in other places the ground would be
hard, and at one place we ran across a bottom which
was composed of a loose gravel, resembling shelled corn.
Out in the ocean, however, was found the ideal
submarine course, consisting of a fine gray sand, almost
as hard as a macadamized road, and very level and uniform.”</p>

<p>During this cruise under the waters of Chesapeake Bay,
the <i>Argonaut</i> came on the wrecks of several sunken vessels,
which Mr. Lake or some member of his crew examined
through the open door in the bottom of the diving-compartment.
The air inside was kept at a sufficiently
high pressure to keep the water from entering, and the
man in the submarine could pull up pieces of the wreck
with a short boathook, or even reach down and place his
bare hand on the back of a big fish swimming past. Sometimes
members of the crew would put on diving-suits and
walk out over the bottom, keeping in communication with
the boat by telephone. Telephone stations were even established
on the bottom of the bay, with cables running to
the nearest exchange on shore, and conversations were
held with people in Baltimore, Washington, and New
York. (Perhaps the commanders of German submarines
in British waters to-day are using this method to communicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
with German spies in London, Dublin, and Liverpool.)</p>

<p>The Spanish-American War was being fought while
Mr. Lake was making these experiments. The entrance
to Hampton Roads was planted with electric mines, but
though he was forbidden to go too near them, the inventor
proved that nothing would be easier than to locate
the cable connecting them with the shore, haul it up into
the diver’s compartment of the <i>Argonaut</i> and cut it. He
did this with a dummy cable of his own, and then repeatedly
begged the navy department to let him take the
<i>Argonaut</i> into the harbor of Santiago de Cuba and disable
the mines that were keeping Admiral Sampson’s fleet from
going in and smashing the Spanish squadron there. But
his offer, like that of John P. Holland, was refused.</p>

<p>“In 1898, also,” says Mr. Lake, “the <i>Argonaut</i> made
the trip from Norfolk to New York under her own power
and unescorted. In her original form she was a cigar-shaped
craft with only a small percentage of reserve buoyancy
in her surface cruising condition. We were caught
out in the severe November northeast storm of 1898 in
which over two hundred vessels were lost and we did not
succeed in reaching a harbor in the ‘horseshoe’ back of
Sandy Hook until three o’clock in the morning. The seas
were so rough they would break over her conning-tower
in such masses I was obliged to lash myself fast to
prevent being swept overboard. It was freezing weather
and I was soaked and covered with ice on reaching harbor.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Argonaut</i> as Rebuilt.</div></div>

<p>Mr. Lake then sent the <i>Argonaut</i> to a Brooklyn shipyard,
where her original cigar-shaped hull was cut in half,
and lengthened twenty feet, after which a light ship-shaped
superstructure was built over her low sloping topsides.
To keep it from being crushed in by water pressure
when submerged, scupper-like openings were cut in
the thin plating where it joined the stout, pressure-resisting
hull, so that the superstructure automatically filled
itself with sea-water on submerging and drained itself on
rising again. Though uninhabitable, its interior supplied
useful storage space, particularly for the gasoline fuel
tanks, which, as Mr. Lake had already discovered, gave
off fumes that soon rendered the air inside the submarine
unbreathable, unless the tanks were kept outside instead
of inside the hull. The swan-bow and long bowsprit of
the new superstructure, together with the two ventilator-masts,
gave the rebuilt <i>Argonaut</i> a schooner-like appearance,
and her bowsprit has been compared to the whip-socket
on the dashboard of the earliest automobiles.
But Mr. Lake declares that this was no useless leftover
but a practicable spring-buffer to guard against running
into submerged rocks, while the bobstay helped the <i>Argonaut</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
to climb over the obstruction, as she could over
anything on the sea-bottom she could get her bows over.</p>

<p>Primarily, the superstructure served to make the submarine
more seaworthy as a surface craft. Until then,
most inventors and designers of undersea boats had confined
their attentions to the problems of underwater navigation
only, because, as had been pointed out by the monk
Mersenne before 1648, even during the most violent
storms the disturbance is felt but a little distance below
the surface. But Mr. Lake realized that a submarine,
like every other kind of boat, spends most of its existence
on top of the water and that it is not always desirable to
submerge whenever a moderate-sized wave sweeps over
one of the old-fashioned, low-lying, cigar-shaped vessels.
With her new superstructure, the <i>Argonaut</i> rode the
waves as lightly as any yacht and ushered in the era
of the sea-going submarine.</p>

<p>It was not until a year later that the <i>Narval</i>, a large
double-hulled submarine with a ship-shaped outer shell of
light, perforated plating, was launched in France. She
was propelled by steam on the surface and by storage batteries
when submerged. To distinguish this sea-going
torpedo-boat, that could be submerged, from the earlier
and simpler submarines designed and engined for underwater
work only, her designer, M. Labeuf, called the
<i>Narval</i> a “submersible.” As the old type of boat soon
became extinct, the distinction was not necessary and the
old name “submarine” is still applied to all underwater
craft. That Simon Lake and not M. Labeuf first gave
the modern sea-going submarine its characteristic and essential
superstructure is easily proved by dates. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
<i>Narval</i> was launched in October, 1899, the <i>Argonaut</i> was
remodeled in December, 1898, and on April 2, 1897, Mr.
Lake applied for and was presently granted the pioneer
patent on a “combined surface and submarine vessel,”
the space between its cylindrical hull and the superstructure
“being adapted to be filled with water when the vessel
is submerged and thus rendered capable of resisting
the pressure of the water.”</p>

<p>But though in her remodeled form she became the
forerunner of the long grim submarine cruisers of to-day,
the <i>Argonaut</i> herself had been built to serve not as a
warship but as a commercial vessel. Like her namesakes
who followed Jason in the <i>Argo</i> to far-off Colchis for
the Golden Fleece, she was to go forth in search of hidden
treasure. She was to have been the first of a fleet
of wheeled bottom-workers, salvaging the cargoes of
wrecked ships; from the mail-bags of the latest lost liner
to ingots and pieces-of-eight from the sand-clogged hulks
of long-sunk Spanish galleons, or bringing up sponges,
coral, and pearls from the depths of the tropic seas.
But though he investigated a few wrecks and ingeniously
transferred a few tons of coal from one into a submarine
lighter by means of a pipe-line and a powerful
force-pump, Mr. Lake has done nothing more to develop
the fascinating commercial possibilities of the submarine
since 1901, because he has been kept too busy building
undersea warships for the United States and other naval
powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. Lake declares that one of his up-to-date wheeled
submarines could enter a harbor-mouth defended by
booms and nettings that would keep out either surface
torpedo boats or ordinary submarines. The smooth-backed
bottom-worker of this special type would slip under
the netting like a cat under a bead portière. If the
netting were fastened down, a diver would step out
through the door in the bottom of the submarine and
either cut the netting from its moorings or attach a bomb
to blow a hole for the bottom-worker to go in through.
An ordinary submarine, entering a hostile harbor, would
be in constant danger of running aground in shallow water
and either sticking there or rebounding to the surface,
to be seen and fired at by the enemy. Even if its commander
succeeded in keeping to the deep channel by
dead reckoning&mdash;a process akin to flying blindfolded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
an aeroplane up a crooked ravine and remembering just
when and where to turn&mdash;even if he dodged the rocks
and sand bars, he would be liable to bump the nose of his
boat against an anchored contact mine (see Chapter XI).
But the Lake bottom-worker would trundle steadily along,
sampling the bottom to find where it was, and passing
safely under the mines floating far above it. The divers
would make short work of cutting the mine cables, or they
might plant mines of their own under the ships in the
harbor and blow them up as Bushnell tried to. Using
electric motors and storage air-flasks, with no pipe masts
or other “surface-indications” to betray its presence,
one of these boats could remain snugly hid at the bottom
of an enemy’s harbor as long as its supplies held out.</p>

  <div class="caption">Cross-section of Diving-compartment on a Lake Submarine.</div></div>

<p>As yet, however, we have not heard of any such exploits
in the present war, though they seem perfectly
feasible. Mr. Lake sold a boat designed for this sort of
work and called the <i>Protector</i> to Russia in 1906.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of the Lake submarines
is not the wheels, which are found only on those specially
designed for bottom working, but the hydroplanes.
These are horizontal rudders that are so placed and designed
as to steer the boat forward and downward, but
at the same time keeping it on an even keel. Bushnell
and Nordenfeldt forced their boats straight up and down
like buckets in a well, John P. Holland made his tip
up its tail and dive like a loon, but Mr. Lake conceived the
idea of having his boat descend like a suitcase carried by
a man walking down-stairs: the suitcase moves steadily
forward and downward towards the front door but it remains
level. The first method with its vertical propellers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
wasted too much energy, the second incurred the risk
of diving too fast and too deep, no matter whether the
single pair of horizontal rudders were placed on the
bow, or amidships, or on the stern. So Mr. Lake used
two pairs of horizontal rudders “located at equal distances
forward and aft of the center of gravity and buoyancy
of the vessel when in the submerged condition, so as
not to disturb the trim of the vessel when the planes were
inclined down or up to cause the vessel to submerge or
rise when under way.” These he called hydroplanes, to
distinguish them from another set of smaller horizontal
rudders, which at first he called “leveling-vanes” and
which were not used to steer the submarine under but
manipulated to keep her at a constant depth and on a level
keel while running submerged.</p>

<p>In theory, the early Lake boats were submerged on an
even keel; in practice, they went under at an angle of several
degrees. But they made nothing like the abrupt
dives of the <i>Holland</i>.</p>

<p>“As the Electric Boat Company’s boats (Holland
type) increased in size,” declares Chief Constructor D.
W. Taylor, U.S.N., “bow rudders were fitted, and nowadays
all submarines of this type in our navy are fitted
with bow rudders as well as stern rudders. The Lake
type submarines are still fitted with hydroplanes. But as
you may see, means for effecting submergence have approached
each other very closely: in fact, speaking generally,
submarines all over the world now have two or
more sets of diving-rudders; the most general arrangement
is one pair forward and one pair aft; in some types<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
three pairs are fitted, but this arrangement is more unusual.</p>

<p>“In general it may be said then that modern submarines
of both types submerge in practically the same
way. They assume a very slight angle of inclination, say
a degree and a half or two degrees, and submerge at this
angle. This may be said to be practically on an even
keel.”</p>

<p>When the Krupps first took up the idea of constructing
submarines for the German and Russian governments,
the great German firm consulted with Mr. Lake, who was
at that time living in Europe. An elaborate contract was
drawn up between them. The Krupps agreed to employ
Mr. Lake in an advisory capacity and to build “Lake
type” boats, both in Russia, where they were to erect a
factory and share the profits with him, and in Germany,
on a royalty basis. Before he could sign this contract,
Mr. Lake had to obtain the permission of the directors
of his own company in Bridgeport. In the meanwhile,
he gave the German company his most secret plans and
specifications. But the Krupps never signed the contract,
withdrew from going into Russia, and their lawyer coolly
told Mr. Lake that, as he had failed to patent his inventions
in Germany, his clients were perfectly free to build
“Lake type” submarines there without paying him anything
and were going to do so.</p>

<p>The famous Krupp-built German submarines that are
playing so prominent a part in the present war are therefore
partly of American design. Whenever Mr. Lake
reads that another one of them has been destroyed by the
Allies, his emotions must be rather mixed.</p>

<span class="subhead">A TRIP IN A MODERN SUBMARINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Lieutenant Perry Scope</span>, commanding the
X-class flotilla, was sitting in his comfortable little
office on the mother-ship <i>Ozark</i>, when I entered with a
letter from the secretary of the navy, giving me permission
to go on board a United States submarine. Without
such authorization no civilian may set foot on the
narrow decks of our undersea destroyers, though he may
visit a battleship with no more formality than walking
into a public park.</p>

<p>“We’re too small and full of machinery to hold a
crowd,” explained the lieutenant, “and the crowd
wouldn’t enjoy it if they came. No nice white decks for
the girls to dance on or fourteen-inch guns for them to
sit on while they have their pictures taken. Besides,
everything’s oily&mdash;you’d better put on a suit of overalls
instead of those white flannels.”</p>

<p>There were plenty of spare overalls on the <i>Ozark</i>, for
she was the mother-ship of a family of six young submarines.
Built as a coast defense monitor shortly after
the Spanish War, she had long since been retired from the
fighting-line, and was now the floating headquarters, dormitory,
hospital, machine-shop, bakery, and general store
for the six officers and the hundred and fifty men of the
flotilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Moored alongside the parent-ship, the submarine <i>X-4</i>
was filling her fuel-tanks with oil through a pipe-line, in
preparation for the day’s cruise and target-practice I was
to be lucky enough to witness. Two hundred and fifty
feet long, flat-decked and straight-stemmed, she looked,
except for the lack of funnels, much more like a surface-going
torpedo-boat than the landsman’s conventional idea
of a submarine.</p>

<p>“I thought she would be cigar-shaped,” I said as we
went on board.</p>

<p>“She is&mdash;underneath,” answered Lieutenant Scope.
“What you see is only a light-weight superstructure or
false hull built over the real one. See those holes in it,
just above the water line? They are to flood the superstructure
with whenever we submerge, otherwise the
water pressure would crush in these thin steel plates like
veneering. But it makes us much more seaworthy for
surface work, gives us a certain amount of deckroom,
and stowage-space for various useful articles, such as
this.”</p>

<p>Part of the deck rose straight up into the air, like the
top of a freight-elevator coming up through the sidewalk.
Beneath the canopy thus formed was a short-barreled,
three-inch gun.</p>

<p>“Fires a twelve-pound shell, like the field-pieces the
landing-parties take ashore from the battleships,” explained
the naval officer, as he trained the vicious-looking
little cannon all around the compass. “Small enough to
be handy, big enough to sink any merchant ship afloat,
or smash anything that flies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Here he pointed the muzzle straight up as if gunning
for hostile aeroplanes.</p>

<p>“And please observe,” he concluded, as the gun
sank down into its lair again, “how that armored hatch-cover
protects the gun-crew from shrapnel or falling
bombs.”</p>

<p>I followed him to the conning-tower, or, as he always
spoke of it, the turret. The little round bandbox of the
<i>Holland</i> has developed into a tall, tapering structure,
sharply pointed fore and aft to lessen resistance when running
submerged. Above the turret was a small navigating-bridge,
screened and roofed with canvas, where a red-haired
quartermaster stood by the steering-wheel, and
saluted as we came up the ladder. The lieutenant put the
engine-room telegraph over to “Start,” and a mighty
motor throbbed underneath our feet. Then the mooring
was cast off, the telegraph put over to “Slow Ahead,”
and the <i>X-4</i> put out to sea.</p>

<p>“How long a cruise could she make?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Four thousand miles is her radius,” answered her
commander. “Back in 1915, ten American-designed submarines
crossed from Canada to England under their
own power.”</p>

<p>“Yet it is only a few years since we were told that
submarines could only be used for coast defense, unless
they were carried inside their mother-ships and launched
near the scene of battle,” I remarked. “Or that each
battleship should carry a dinky little submarine on deck
and lower it over the side like a steam-launch.”</p>

<p>“People said the same thing about torpedo-boats,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
agreed the lieutenant; “they began as launches&mdash;now
look at the size of that destroyer smoking along over
there. Ericsson thought that any ironclad bigger than a
Civil War monitor would be an unwieldy monster. Even
John P. Holland fought tooth and nail against increasing
the length of his submarines. This boat of mine is five
times the length of the old <i>Holland</i>, but she’s only a
primitive ancestor of the perfect submarine of the future.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t a submarine at all,” I replied presently, as
the <i>X-4</i> swept on down the coast at a good twenty-two
knots, her foredeck buried in foam and the sea-breeze
singing through the antennæ of her wireless. “She’s
nothing but a big motor-boat.”</p>

<p>“And she’s got some big motors,” replied the lieutenant.
“Better step below and have a look at them.”</p>

<p>I went down through the open hatchway to the interior
of the boat and aft to the engine-room. There I found
two long, many-cylindered oil-engines of strange design,
presided over by a big blond engineer whose grease-spotted
dungarees gave no hint as to his rating.</p>

<p>“What kind of machines are these?” I shouted above
the roar they made. “And why do you need two of
them?”</p>

<p>“Diesel heavy-oil engines,” he answered. “One for
each propeller.”</p>

<p>“What is the difference between one of these and the
gasoline engine of a motor-car? I know a little about
that.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what the carburetor is?” asked the
engineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
“That’s where the gasoline is mixed with air, before
it goes into the cylinder.”</p>

<p>The engineer nodded.</p>

<p>“The mixture is sucked into the cylinder by the down-stroke
of the piston. The up-stroke compresses it, and
then the mixture is exploded by an electric spark from the
spark-plug. The force of the explosion drives the piston
down, and the next stroke up drives out the refuse
gases. That’s how an ordinary, four-cycle gasoline
motor works.</p>

<p>“But the Diesel engine,” he continued, “doesn’t need
any carburetor or spark-plug. When the piston makes
its first upward or compression-stroke, there is nothing in
the cylinder but pure air. This is compressed to a pressure
of about 500 pounds a square inch&mdash;and when you
squeeze anything as hard as that, you make it mighty
hot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Like a blacksmith pounding a piece of cold iron
to a red heat?” I suggested. The engineer nodded
again.</p>

<p>“That compressed air is so hot that the oil which has
been spurted in through an injection-valve is exploded,
and drives the piston down on the power-stroke. The
waste gases are then blown out by compressed air. There
are an air-compressor and a storage tank just for scavenging,
or blowing the waste gases out of every three power-cylinders.”</p>

<p>“What are the advantages of the Diesel over the gasoline
engine?”</p>

  <div class="caption">Auxiliary Switchboard and Electric Cook-stove, in a U.&nbsp;S.
Submarine.</div></div>

<p>“In the first place, it gives more power. You see,
three out of every four strokes made by the piston of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
gasoline engine&mdash;suction-stroke, compression-stroke, and
scavenging-stroke&mdash;waste power instead of producing it.
But the Diesel is what we call a two-cycle engine; its
piston makes only two trips for each power-stroke. In
the second place, it is cheaper, because instead of gasoline
it uses heavy, low-price oil. And this makes it much
safer, for the heavy oil does not vaporize so easily. The
air in some of the old submarines that used gasoline
motors would get so that it was like trying to breathe inside
a carburetor, and there was always the chance of a
spark from the electric motors exploding the whole
business, and your waking up to find the trained nurse
changing your bandages. The German navy refused to
build a submarine as long as there was nothing better
than gasoline to propel it on the surface. They didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
launch their <i>U-1</i> till 1906, after Dr. Diesel had got his
motor into practicable shape. It cost him twenty years
of hard work, but without his motor we couldn’t have
the modern submarine. And they’re using it more and
more in ocean freighters. There’s a line of motor-ships
running to-day between Scandinavia and San Francisco,
through the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>“Aft of the Diesel, here,” continued the engineer, “is
our electric motor, for propelling her when submerged.
Reverse it and have it driven by the Diesel engine, and the
motor serves as a dynamo to generate electricity for charging
the batteries. As long as we can get oil and come to
the surface to use it, we can never run short of ‘juice.’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>“Besides turning the propeller, the electricity from the
batteries lights the boat, and turns the ventilating fans,
works the air-compressor for the torpedo-tubes, drives all
the big and little pumps, runs a lot of auxiliary motors
that haul up the anchor, turn the rudders, and do other
odd jobs, it heats the boat in cold weather&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And cooks the grub all the year round, don’t forget
that, Joe,” said another member of the crew. “Luncheon
is served in the palm room.”</p>

<p>We ate from a swinging table let down from the ceiling
of the main-&nbsp;or living-compartment of the submarine,
that extended forward from the engine-room to the tiny
officers’ cabin and the torpedo room in the bows. Tiers
of canvas bunks folded up against the walls showed where
the crew slept when on a cruise. For lunch that day we
had bread baked on the mother-ship, butter out of a can,
fried ham, fried potatoes, and coffee hot from a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
electric stove such as you can see in the kitchenette of a
light-housekeeping apartment on shore. The lieutenant’s
lunch was carried up to him on the bridge. When the
meal was over, most of the men went on deck, and my
friend the engineer put a large cigar in his mouth. I
took out a box of matches and was about to strike one
for his benefit when he stopped me, saying,</p>

<p>“Don’t ever strike a light in a submarine or a dynamite
factory. It’s unhealthy.”</p>

  <div class="caption">Forward deck of a U. S. Submarine, in cruising trim.</div></div>

<p>I apologized profusely.</p>

<p>“The air is so much better than I had expected that
I forgot where I was.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the engineer, chewing his unlighted cigar,
“there is plenty of good air in a big modern boat like
this, running on the surface in calm weather and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the main hatch and all ventilators open. But come with
us when we’re bucking high seas or running submerged
on a breathing-diet of canned air flavored with oil, and
you’ll understand why so many good men have been invalided
out of the flotilla with lung-trouble. We’re the
only warships without any dogs or parrots or other mascots
on board, for no animal could endure the air in
a submarine.”</p>

<p>“I thought every submarine carried a cage of white
mice, because they began to squeak as soon as the air
began to get bad and so warned the crew.”</p>

<p>“That was a crude device of the early days,” replied
the engineer. “We don’t carry white mice any more,
though I believe they still use them in the British navy.”</p>

<p>I went up on deck, to find that the <i>X-4</i> had reached
the practice-grounds and was being made ready for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
dive. Her crew were busy dismantling and stowing away
the bridge and the light deck-railing, hauling down the
flag, and closing all ventilators and other openings.</p>

<p>“How long has it taken you to get ready?” I asked
Lieutenant Scope.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes,” he answered. “But the real diving
takes only two minutes. We’ll go below now, sink
her to condition, and run her under with the diving rudders.”</p>

<p>“What are those things unfolding themselves on either
side of the bows?” I asked. “I thought the diving rudders
were carried astern.”</p>

<p>“Modern submarines are so long that they need them
both fore and aft,” replied the lieutenant. “As you see,
the diving rudders fold flat against the side of the boat
where they will be out of harm’s way when we are running
on the surface or lying alongside the mother-ship.
Better come below now, for we’re going to dive.”</p>

<p>We descended into the turret and the hatch was closed.
The Diesel engines had already been stopped and the
electric motors were now turning the propellers.</p>

<p>“Why are those big electric pumps working down
there?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Pumping water into the ballast-tanks.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t the water run into the tanks anyhow, as
soon as you open the valves?” I asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Turn a tumbler upside down and force it down into
a basin of water,” he replied, “and you trap some air
in the top of the tumbler, which prevents the water from
rising beyond a certain point. The same thing takes
place in our tanks, and to fill them we have to force in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the water with powerful pumps that compress the air in
the tanks to a very small part of its original bulk. This
compressed air acts as a powerful spring to drive the
water out of the tanks again when we wish to rise. By
blowing out the tanks, a submarine can come to the surface
in twenty seconds or one sixth the time it takes to
submerge.”</p>

<p>“When are we going under?” I asked him. The lieutenant
looked at his watch and answered,</p>

<p>“We have been submerged for the last four minutes.”</p>

<p>I experienced a feeling of the most profound disappointment.
Ever since I had been a very small boy I had
been looking forward to the time when I should go down
in a submarine boat, and now that time had passed without
my realizing it.</p>

<p>“But why didn’t I feel the boat tilt when she dived?”
I demanded.</p>

<p>“Because she went down a very gentle slope, between
two and three degrees at the steepest. The only way you
could have noticed it would have been to watch these
gages.”</p>

<p>Large dials on the wall of the turret indicated that the
<i>X-4</i> was running on what was practically an even keel at
a depth of sixteen feet and under a consequent water-pressure
of 1024 pounds on every square foot of her hull.</p>

<p>“How deep could she go?”</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty feet&mdash;if she had to. The
strong inner hull of a modern submarine is built up of
three quarter inch plates of the best mild steel and well
braced and strengthened from within. But as a rule
there is no need of our diving below sixty feet at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
deepest, or far enough to clear the keel of the largest
ship. You will notice how the depth-control man is
holding her steady by manipulating the forward horizontal
rudders, just as an aviator steadies his aeroplane.”</p>

  <span class="smaller">Wheel governing horizontal rudders, gages showing depth, trim, etc.</span></div></div>

<p>“He must be a strong man to handle those two big
horizontal rudders.”</p>

<p>“He has an electric motor to do the hard work for him,
as has the quartermaster steering the course here with
the vertical rudder.”</p>

<p>The same red-headed petty officer that I had noticed
on the bridge now grasped the spokes of a smaller steering-wheel
inside the conning-tower.</p>

<p>“What is that queer-looking thing whirling round and
round in front of him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A Sperry gyroscopic compass,” replied the lieutenant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
“An ordinary magnetic compass could not be relied on
to point in any particular direction if it was shut up in
a steel box full of charged electric wires, like the turret
of a submarine. We tried to remedy this by building conning-towers
of copper, till Mr. Sperry perfected a compass
that has no magnetic
needle, but operates on
the principle of the
gyroscope. You know
that a heavy, rapidly
rotating wheel resists
any tendency to being
shifted relative to
space?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<div id="ip_114" class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Cross-section of a Periscope.</div></div>

<p>“The earth, revolving
on its axis, is nothing
but a big gyroscope&mdash;that
is why it stays
put. The little gyroscope
on this compass
spins at right angles to
the revolution of the
earth and so keeps in a
due north and south
line. But the frame it is mounted on turns with the
ship, so the relative positions of the frame and the gyro-axis
show in what direction the submarine is heading.”</p>

<p>“And you can see what’s ahead of you through the
periscope. Who invented that?”</p>

<p>“The idea is a very old one. Certain French and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Dutch inventors designed submarines with periscopes as
long ago as the eighteen-fifties. In the Civil War, the
light-draft river-monitor <i>Osage</i> had attached to her turret
a crude periscope made by her chief engineer, Thomas
Doughty, out of a piece of three-inch steam-pipe with
holes cut at each of its ends at opposite sides, and pieces
of looking-glass inserted as reflectors. By means of
this instrument her captain, now Rear-Admiral, Thomas
O. Selfridge, was able to look over the high banks of the
Red River when the <i>Osage</i> had run aground in a bend
and was being attacked by three thousand dismounted
Confederate cavalry, who were repulsed with the loss of
four hundred killed or wounded by the fire of the monitor’s
11-inch guns, directed through the periscope.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>“But as late as 1900 the periscope was so crude and unsatisfactory
an instrument that John P. Holland would
have nothing to do with it. The credit for bringing it
to its present efficiency belongs chiefly to the Germans,
who kept many of their scientists working together on
the solution of the difficult problems of optics that were
involved.</p>

<p>“By turning this little crank,” the lieutenant continued,
“I can revolve the reflector at the top of the tube. This
reflector contains a prism which reflects the image of the
object in view down through a system of lenses in the
tube to another prism here at the bottom, where the observer
sees it through an eyepiece and telescope lenses.”</p>

<p>I looked into the eyepiece, which was so much like that
of an old-fashioned stereoscope that I felt that it, too,
ought to work back and forth after the manner of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
slide trombone. I found myself looking out over the
broad blue waters of a sunlit bay. I noticed a squall
blackening the surface of the water, a catboat running
before it, and the gleam of the brass instruments of the
band playing on the after deck of a big white excursion
steamer half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I can almost imagine I can hear the music of that
band,” I exclaimed. “The optical illusion is perfect.”</p>

<p>“It has to be,” rejoined the lieutenant. “If the image
were in the least distorted or out of perspective, we
couldn’t aim straight.”</p>

<p>“What do you do when the periscope is wet with
spray?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Wash the glass with a jet of alcohol and dry it from
the inside with a current of warm air passing up and
down the tube. A periscope-tube is double: the outer
one passing through a stuffing-box in the hull, and the inner
tube revolving inside it. The old-fashioned single
tubes were too hard to revolve and the resistance of the
water used to bend them aft and cause leakage. We can
raise and lower the periscopes at will, and all our larger
boats have two of them, so that they can keep a lookout
in two directions at once, besides having a spare eye
in case the first is put out.”</p>

<p>“What are those two little things that big naval tug
is towing over there?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“The target for our torpedo practice,” replied Lieutenant
Scope. “We shall try to put four Whiteheads
between those two buoys as the tug tows them past at an
unknown range and speed. If you step forward to the
torpedo room you can see them loading the tubes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
As I walked forward it occurred to me that the twenty-odd
men on board the <i>X-4</i> seemed to be moving about
inside her with perfect freedom, without disturbing her
trim. I mentioned this to one of the crew.</p>

<div id="ip_117" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <div class="caption">Forward torpedo-compartment, U. S. Submarine, showing breech-mechanism
     of four tubes. Round opening above is the escape-hatch.
</div></div>

<p>“It’s the trimming-tanks that keep her level,” he explained.
“As we’re walking forward, our weight in
water is being automatically pumped from the trimming-tank
in the bow to the one astern. A submarine is just
one blamed tank after another. Stand clear of that
chain-fall, sir; they’re loading No. 1 tube.”</p>

<p>Stripped to the waist like an old-time gun-crew, four
beautifully muscled young gunner’s mates were hoisting,
with an ingenious arrangement of chains and pulleys, a
torpedo from the magazine. The breach of the tube was
opened and the long Whitehead thrust in, two flanges on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
its sides being fitted into deep grooves in the sides of the
tube, so that the torpedo would not spin like a rifle-bullet
but be launched on an even keel. The breach was closed,
and the men stood by expectantly.</p>

<p>“Skipper’s up in the conning-tower, taking aim
through the periscope,” explained the man who had told
me about trimming-tanks. “The tubes being fixed in the
bow, he has to train the whole boat like a gun. Likewise
he’s got to figure out how far it is to the target and how
fast the tug is towing it, how many seconds it’s going to
take the torpedo to get there, and how much he’s got to
allow for its being carried off its course by tide and currents.
When he gets good and ready, the lieutenant’ll
press a little electric button and you’ll hear&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Thud!</span>” went the compressed air in the tube, and the
submarine shuddered slightly with the shock of the recoil.
But that was all.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” said my friend the tank-expert.
“As soon as the Whitehead was expelled, a compensation-tank
just above the tube was flooded with enough water
to make good the loss in weight.”</p>

<p>“What keeps the sea-water from rushing into the tube
after the torpedo leaves it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A conical-shaped cap on the bow of the boat keeps
both tubes closed except when you want to fire one of
them. Then the cap, which is pivoted on its upper edge,
swings to port or starboard just long enough for the torpedo
to get clear and swings back before the water can
get in.”</p>

<p>Four of the ten torpedoes carried in the magazine were
sped on their way to the unseen target. I returned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the turret as the wireless operator entered and handed a
typewritten slip to Lieutenant Scope, who smiled happily
and said to me,</p>

<p>“The captain of the tug reports that all four shots
were hits and all four torpedoes have been safely recovered.”</p>

<p>I was too astonished to congratulate him on his marksmanship,
as I should have done.</p>

<p>“How in the name of miracles!” I gasped. “Can
you receive a wireless telegram under the sea?”</p>

<p>“By the Fessenden oscillator,” he replied, and added
to the wireless man,</p>

<p>“Take this gentleman below and show him how it
works.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever have another chap knock two stone together
under water when you were taking a dive?” asked
the operator. I nodded in vivid recollection.</p>

<p>“Then you have some idea how sounds are magnified
under water. It is an old idea to put submarine bells
down under lighthouses and fit ships with some kind of
receiver so that the bells can be heard and warning given
when it is too foggy to see the light. The advantage over
the old-style bell-buoy lies in the fact that sound travels
about four times as fast through water as through air,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
and goes further and straighter because it isn’t deflected
by winds or what the aviators call ‘air-pockets.’ The
man who knows most about these things is Professor
Fessenden, of the Submarine Signal Company of Boston,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
who first realized the possibility of telegraphing through
water.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

  <div class="caption">Fessenden oscillator outside the hull of a ship. The “ear” of
     a modern vessel.</div></div>

<p>“Fastened outside the hull of this boat is one of the
Fessenden oscillators: a steel disk eighteen inches in
diameter, that can be vibrated very rapidly by electricity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
These vibrations travel through the water, like wireless
waves through the ether, till they strike the oscillator on
another vessel and set it to vibrating in sympathy. To
send a message, I start and stop the oscillator with this
key so as to form the dots and dashes of the Morse code.
To receive, I sit here with these receivers over my ears
and ‘listen in,’ just like a wireless operator, till I pick up
our call ‘X-4,’ ‘X-4.’”</p>

<p>“How far can you send a message under water?”</p>

<p>“Ten miles is the furthest I’ve ever sent one. Professor
Fessenden has sent messages more than thirty miles.
The invention only dates back to 1913 and what it will
do in the future, there is no telling.”</p>

  <div class="caption">Professor Fessenden receiving a message sent through several
    miles of sea-water by his “Oscillator.”</div></div>

<p>“Even now, couldn’t a surface vessel act as eyes for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
a whole flotilla of submarines and tell them where to
go and when to strike by coaching them through the
Fessenden oscillator?”</p>

<p>The operator nodded.</p>

<p>“We’re doing it to-day, in practice. But don’t forget
that an enemy’s ship carrying a pair of oscillators can
hear a submarine coming two miles away. You can
make out the beat of a propeller at that distance every
time.”</p>

<p>“But how can you tell how far away and in what
direction it is?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, with a single oscillator like ours. But a ship
carries two of them, one on each side of the hull, like the
ears on a man’s head. And just as a man knows whether
a shout he hears comes from the right or left, because
he hears it more with one ear than the other, so the
skipper of a surface craft can look at the indicator that
registers the relative intensity of the vibrations received
by the port and starboard oscillators and say,</p>

<p>“‘There’s somebody three points off the starboard
bow, mile and three quarters away, and heading for us.
Nothing in sight, so it must be one of those blamed submarines.’</p>

<p>“And away he steams, full speed ahead and cutting
zigzags. Or maybe he gets his rapid-fire guns ready and
watches for Mr. Submarine to rise&mdash;like the <i>X-4</i>’s doing
now.”</p>

<p>Freed of the dead weight of many tons of sea water
blown from her ballast-tanks by compressed air, the submarine
rose to the surface like a balloon. Ventilators
and hatch-covers were thrown open and we swarmed up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
on deck to fill our grateful lungs with the good sea air.
Three motor-boats from the tug throbbed up alongside
with the four torpedoes we had discharged.</p>

<p>“Those boats wait, one this side of the target, one near
it and the third over on the far side, to mark the shots
and catch the torpedoes after they rise to the surface at
the end of their run,” said Lieutenant Scope. “We very
seldom lose a torpedo nowadays. They tell a story about
one that dived to the bottom and was driven by the force
of its own engines into forty feet of soft mud, where
it stayed till it happened to be dug up by a dredger.”</p>

<p>The four torpedoes were hoisted aboard, drained of
the sea water that had flooded their air-chambers, cleaned
and lowered through the torpedo hatch forward down
into the magazine. By this time the bridge and railing
were again in place and the flags fluttering over the
taffrail as the <i>X-4</i>, her day’s work done, sped swiftly up
the coast to home and mother-ship.</p>

<p>The <i>A-1</i> was engaged in manœuvers off Spithead, England,
when she rose to the surface right under the bows
of the fast-steaming Union Castle Liner <i>Berwick Castle</i>.
Before anything could be done, the sharp prow of the
steamer had cut a great gash in the thin hull of the submarine
and sent her to the bottom with all her crew.
This was in broad daylight; her sister-ship <i>C-11</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
rammed and sunk by another liner three years later, at
night. The <i>Pluviôse</i> of the French navy escaped the bow
of an on-coming cross-channel steamer when the submarine
came up at the entrance to Calais Harbor, only to
have her topsides crushed in by a blow from one of the
paddle-wheels. Collisions like these are less likely to happen
nowadays, for the navigating officer of a modern submarine
can take a look round the horizon through the
periscope from a depth sufficient to let most steamers
pass harmlessly over him, and in case of darkness or fog,
he can detect the vibrations of approaching propellers by
means of the Fessenden oscillator or some similar device.
Yet the frequency with which submarines have been intentionally
rammed and sunk in the present war shows
that they would still be liable to rise blindly to their destruction
in time of peace.</p>

<p>The vapor from a leaking fuel-tank, making an explosive
mixture with the air inside the submarine and set
off by a spark from the electrical machinery, has caused
many accidents of another kind. Such an explosion took
place on the original <i>Holland</i>, shortly after she was taken
into the government service, but fortunately without killing
any one. As the crew of the British <i>A-5</i> were filling
the fuel tanks of their vessel with gasoline, some of
them were blown up through the open hatchway and into
the sea by a burst of flaming vapor that killed six men
and terribly injured twelve more. A rescue party that
entered the boat to save the men still left aboard had
several of its own members disabled by a second explosion.
The vessel itself, however, was almost unharmed. But
not long afterwards, another submarine of the same ill-fated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
class, the <i>A-8</i>, was lying off Plymouth breakwater
with her hatches open, when the people on shore heard
three distinct explosions on board her and saw her suddenly
submerge. Her crew evidently got the hatches
closed before she went down, as they sent up signals that
they were alive but unable to rise. Two hours later a
fourth explosion took place and all hope was abandoned.</p>

<p>This danger has been guarded against by better construction
of tanks and valves, and very greatly lessened
by the substitution of the heavy oil used in the Diesel
engines for the more costly and volatile gasoline.</p>

<p>Besides igniting explosive oil vapors with their sparks,
the old-fashioned sulphuric acid and lead storage batteries
still used in many submarines are a great source of
danger in themselves. The jars are too easily broken,
and the leaking acid eats into the steel plating of the boat,
weakening it if not actually letting in the sea water. And
if salt water comes in contact with a battery of this
type, then chlorin gas&mdash;the same poisonous gas that the
Germans use against the Allies’ trenches&mdash;is generated
and the crew are in very great danger of suffocation.
The new Edison alkali storage battery, besides being
lighter and more durable, uses no acid and cannot give
off chlorin when saturated with sea water.</p>

<p>The remaining great danger is that a submarine may
get out of control and submerge too quickly, so that it
either strikes the bottom, at the risk of being crushed in
or entangled, or descends to so great a depth that its
sides are forced in by the pressure of the water outside,
which also prevents the submarine from discharging the
water in its ballast tanks and escaping to the surface.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Detachable safety weights and keels to lighten the boat
in such an emergency date back to the time of Bushnell
and J. Day. A more modern device is to have a hydrostatic
valve (see page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>) set to correspond with the
pressure of a certain depth of water, so that if the submarine
goes below this the valve will be forced in and
automatically “blow the tanks.”</p>

<p>A submarine that sank too deep was the <i>No. 6</i>, of the
Imperial Japanese navy, which disappeared while manœuvering
in Hiroshima Bay, on April 15, 1910. When she
was found, her entire crew lay dead at their stations, and
in the conning-tower, beside the body of the commander,
was the following letter written by that officer, Lieutenant
Takuma Faotomu:</p>

<p>“Although there is indeed no excuse to make for the
sinking of his Imperial Majesty’s boat, and for the doing
away of subordinates through my heedlessness, all on
board the boat have discharged their duties well and in
everything acted calmly until death. Although we are
dying in the pursuance of our duty to the State, the only
regret we have is due to anxiety lest the men of the world
misunderstand the matter, and that thereby a blow may
be given to the future development of the submarine.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, we hope you will be increasingly diligent
and not fail to appreciate the cause of the accident, and
that you will devote your entire energy to investigate
everything and so secure the future development of submarines.
If this be done we have nothing to regret.</p>

<p>“While going through gasoline submerged exercises
we submerged too far, and when we attempted to shut
the sluice-valve, the chain broke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
“Then we tried to close the sluice-valve by hand, but
it was too late, for the afterpart was full of water, and
the boat sank at an angle of about twenty-five degrees.
The boat came to rest at an incline of about twelve degrees,
pointing towards the stern. The switchboard being
under water the electric lights went out. Offensive
gas developed and breathing became difficult. The boat
sank about 10 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on the 15th, and though suffering at
the time from this offensive gas, we endeavored to expel
the water by hand pumps. As the vessel went down we
expelled the water from the main tank. As the light has
gone out the gage cannot be seen, but we know the water
has been expelled from the main tank.</p>

<p>“We cannot use the electric current at all. The battery
is leaking but no salt water has reached it and
chlorin gas has not developed. We only rely on the
hand pump now.</p>

<p>“The above was written under the light of the conning-tower,
at about 11.45 o’clock. We are now soaked
by the water that has made its way in. Our clothes are
wet and we feel cold. I had been accustomed to warn my
shipmates that their behavior (in an emergency) should
be calm and deliberate, as well as brave, yet not too
deliberate, lest work be retarded. People may be tempted
to ridicule this after this failure, but I am perfectly confident
that my words have not been mistaken.</p>

<p>“The depth gage of the conning-tower indicates 52
feet, and despite our efforts to expel the water the pump
stopped and would not work after 12 o’clock. The depth
in this neighborhood being ten fathoms, the reading may
be correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
“The officers and men of submarines should be chosen
from the bravest of the brave or there will be annoyances
in cases like this. Happily all the members of this crew
have discharged their duties well and I am satisfied.
I have always expected death whenever I left my home,
and therefore my will is already in the drawer at Karasaki.
(This remark applies only to my private affairs
and is really superfluous. Messrs. Taguchi and Asami
will please inform my father of this.)</p>

<p>“I respectfully request that none of the families left
by my subordinates suffer. The only thing I am anxious
about is this.</p>

<p>“Atmospheric pressure is increasing and I feel as if
my tympanum were breaking.</p>

<p>“12.30 o’clock. Respiration is extraordinarily difficult.
I mean I am breathing gasoline. I am intoxicated
with gasoline.</p>

<p>“It is 12.40 o’clock.”</p>

<p>Those were the last words written by Lieutenant
Takuma Faotomu, bravest of the brave.</p>

<p>Very many ingenious devices have been invented to
enable the crew of a stranded submarine to escape. The
best-known and most widely used is some form of the
air-lock or diver’s chamber, as described in the chapter on
the Lake boats. Through this the crew can pass in succession
to the water outside and swim to the surface. If
the depth is so great that an unprotected swimmer would
be crushed by the weight of water above him, there is a
great variety of safety-helmets, and of jackets with
mouth-pieces leading to tanks containing enough air under
moderate pressure to inflate the lungs and cheeks so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
that the internal pressure of the body will counteract that
of the water. An escaping seaman, burdened with such
a device, cannot rise unaided to the surface but must
climb or be hauled up by a rope let down from above.
Moreover, he must not ascend too rapidly, or the pressure
within his body will dangerously exceed that without,
as if he had been suddenly
picked up at the seashore and
carried to the top of the
Andes. The human body is
too delicate and elaborate a
structure to be carelessly
turned into a compressed-air
tank. The surplus oxygen
forms bubbles which try to
force their way out through
the tissues of the body, causing
intense pain, and possibly
paralysis or death. To avoid
this, divers are brought up
from any great depth by
slow and careful stages, unless
they can be placed at
once in specially-constructed
tanks on shore, where the pressure they are under can be
gradually reduced to normal.</p>

<p>A covered lifeboat carried in a socket on the submarine’s
deck, so that in case of accidental stranding the
crew could get into the small boat from below, close the
hatch cover, release the lifeboat from within, and rise
safely and comfortably to the surface, was an attractive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
feature of the <i>Plongeur</i> in 1863, and of many projected
but unbuilt submarines since then. A detachable conning-tower,
containing a small lifeboat that could be
launched after the safety compartment had risen to the
surface, has also been designed and patented more than
once. Theoretically, these devices seem admirable but
naval architects will have none of them. The reason for
this is very simple. A submarine is primarily a warship,
an instrument of destruction, and its carrying capacity
is too limited to permit several hundredweight of torpedoes
or supplies being crowded out by a lifeboat or a
score of safety-helmets. A divers’ compartment and one
or two ordinary diving-suits&mdash;for these things are of
military value&mdash;and a buoy that can be sent up to mark
the spot where the boat has gone down are as much as
you can expect to find in the average naval submarine.</p>

<p>One of the most instructive accidents that ever happened
to an undersea boat was the loss and rescue of the
German <i>U-3</i>. She sank to the bottom of Kiel Harbor
on January 17, 1911. A small spherical buoy was released
and rose to the surface, where it was picked up
and a telephone attached to the end of the thin wire
cable.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Hello! This is the captain of the <i>U-3</i> speaking.
We cannot rise, but we are resting easy and have air
enough to last forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p>“Good. The steam salvage-dock <i>Vulcan</i> has been
sent for and will be here before then, Herr Kapitan.”</p>

<p>But before the <i>Vulcan</i> arrived, it occurred to some one
in authority to attempt to raise the <i>U-3</i> with a large floating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
crane then available. The strong steel chain ready
coiled at the lower end of the buoy-line was drawn up
and made fast to the crane, which could not lift the 300-ton
submarine bodily, but succeeded in hauling up its bow
sufficiently for the twenty-seven petty officers and seamen
on board the <i>U-3</i> to be shot up through the torpedo
tube to the surface. The captain and his two lieutenants
chose to remain. Shortly afterwards the chain slipped
and broke off one of the boat’s ventilators, letting water
into the hull and drowning all three officers.</p>

<p>Then the sea-going, steam salvage-dock <i>Vulcan</i>
reached the scene and brought the <i>U-3</i> to the surface in
three hours.</p>

<p>“The <i>Vulcan</i> is a double-hulled vessel, 230 feet in
length with a lifting capacity of 500 tons. The width
between the two hulls is sufficient to admit with good
clearance the largest submarines. At a suitable height
a shelf is formed along each wall of the interior opening,
and upon this rests the removable floor of the dock. The
two hulls of the ship are each built with water-tight compartments
of large capacity, similar to those which are
found in the side walls of the ordinary floating dock.
When a sunken submarine is to be raised, the <i>Vulcan</i>
steams to the wreck and is moored securely in position
above it. Spanning the well between the two hulls are
two massive gantry cranes, each provided with heavy
lifting tackle driven by electric motors. The first operation
is to fill the compartments until the vessel has sunk
to the required depth. The floor of the dock is then
moved clear of the well. The lifting tackles are now
lowered and made fast, either to chains which have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
slung around the body of the submarine, or to two
massive eyebolts which are permanently riveted into the
submarine’s hull. At the order to hoist away, the submarine
is lifted free from the mud and drawn up within
the well, until its bottom is clear of the supporting shelves
on the inner faces of the two hulls, above referred to.
The dock floor is
then placed in position
on the shelves,
the water is pumped
out of the two hulls,
and the <i>Vulcan</i>
rises, lifting the
submarine and the
dock floor clear of
the water.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

  <div class="caption">The <i>Vulcan</i> salvaging the <i>U-3</i>.</div></div>

<p>A similar vessel
was built by the
French government
as a result of public
indignation over the
delay in raising the
sunken <i>Pluviôse</i>.
Great Britain has a salvage dock with a lifting capacity
of 1000 tons. But the most remarkable craft of this
kind belongs to Italy and was designed by the famous
engineer Major Cesare Laurenti, technical director of the
Fiat-San Giorgio works, builders of some of the world’s
best submarines. She is a twin-hulled vessel, fitted not
only to pick a sunken submarine from the sea bottom, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to care for it in every way, for she is also a floating dry-dock,
capable of repairing two of the largest submarines,
besides being a fully equipped mother-ship for a
flotilla of six. With the ends of her central tunnel closed
by a false stem and stern, and propelled by twin screws
driven by powerful Diesel engines, she is a fast and seaworthy
vessel, capable of keeping company with her flotilla
on a surface cruise. She carries a sufficient armament of
quick-firing guns to beat off a hostile destroyer. But the
most noteworthy feature of the Laurenti dock is a long
steel cylinder, capable of enduring great pressure from
within, that is used to test the resisting strength of new
submarines. A new boat, or a section of a proposed new
type, is placed in this tube, which is filled with water that
is then compressed by pumps, reproducing the effect of
submergence to any desired depth.</p>

<p>The United States navy tests each new submarine built
for it by actually lowering the boat, with no one in it,
to a depth of 200 feet. We have no Laurenti dock, no
<i>Vulcan</i>, no sea-going salvage dock of any kind. The
tender <i>Fulton</i> has a powerful crane, but she cannot be
on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the Far East,
simultaneously.</p>

<p>“The difficulties encountered in raising the sunken
British submarine <i>A-3</i>,” wrote Mr. R.&nbsp;G. Skerrett in the
“Scientific American” some years ago, “have in them
a note of warning for us. We are steadily adding to
our flotilla of under-water boats, and yet we have no
proper facilities in the government service for the
prompt salvage of any of these boats should they be
carried suddenly to the bottom. We have been fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
so far in escaping serious accidents, but that is
no reason for assuming that we are any more likely
to be immune from disaster than any other naval service.
We should profit by the catastrophes which have
befallen England, Russia, France, Germany, and Japan,
and no longer continue unprepared for kindred mishaps.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>We refused to profit and we continued unprepared.
Then came a brief official cablegram from Hawaii,
“Honolulu, March 25, 1915. U.&nbsp;S. submarine <i>F-4</i> left
tender at 9 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> for submerged run. Failed to return
to surface.”</p>

<p>The other two submarines on the station and motor-boats
from the tender <i>Alert</i> cruised about till they found
the spot where oil and air-bubbles were coming to the
surface. Two tugs then swept the bottom with a two-thousand
foot sweep of chains and wire cables, which
caught early the next morning on what proved to be the
lost submarine, in three hundred feet of water, about
a mile and a half outside the entrance to Honolulu Harbor.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours or so the navy department
held out the hope that the men on board her were still
alive and might be rescued. But there was nothing
ready to rescue them with. Three weeks were spent in
building the windlasses for an improvised salvage-dock
made out of two mud scows. In the meanwhile, a detachment
of the department’s most skilled divers were
sent out from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. With their
aid, strong wire cables were passed under the submarine’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
hull. While engaged on this work, one of the divers,
Chief Gunner’s Mate Frank Crilley, broke all deep submergence
records by descending to a depth of 288 feet.
As a result, his lungs were severely injured and he soon
afterwards developed pneumonia.</p>

<p>The wire ropes chafed through and were replaced by
chains. Then the <i>F-4</i> was lifted from the bottom and
towed inshore to a depth of fifty feet. Here a heavy
storm set in and the lines had to be cast off. Six big
cylindrical-shaped pontoons were then built at San Francisco
and brought out to Honolulu on the cruiser <i>Maryland</i>.
Divers passed fresh chains under the <i>F-4</i>, the pontoons
were sunk on either side of her, and coupled together.
Then the water was blown out of the pontoons
by compressed-air piped down from above, the <i>F-4</i> was
raised to the surface, and towed into dry dock.</p>

<p>No decipherable written record was discovered inside
her hull, which was filled with sand washed in through
a large hole made in the plating by the chafing of the
chains. But the story of the disaster was written in the
plates and rivets of the vessel herself, and skilfully deduced
and reconstructed by a board of inquiry, headed
by Rear-Admiral Boush. Their report, which was not
made public till October 27, told dramatically how the
corroded condition of the lead lining in the battery tanks
had let the acid eat away the rivets in the port wall of
the forward tank. Salt water thus entered part of the
battery, producing chlorin gas, which exploded violently,
admitting more water, till the submarine began to sink
by the head, in spite of the raising of her diving-rudders.</p>

<p>“Automatic blow was tripped, and blow valve on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
auxiliary tank opened in the endeavor to check downward
momentum. Manœuvering with propellers probably
took place. The appreciable length of time requisite
for air to build up in ballast tanks for the expulsion
of sufficient quantities of water resulted in the vessel
reaching crushing depth.</p>

<p>“Seams of the vessel began to open, and probably
through open torpedo tubes and seams water entered the
vessel and a condition of positive buoyancy was never
attained.</p>

<p>“There followed actual disaster. The vessel began
filling with water. The personnel abandoned stations
and many sought refuge in the engine room, closing the
door. Under great pressure the engine room bulkhead
failed suddenly, leaving the vessel on the bottom, completely
flooded.”</p>

<p>All the boats of the “F” class had already been withdrawn
from the service, by order of Secretary Daniels.
Their place at Honolulu was taken by four boats of the
“K” class, which made the 2100 mile voyage out from
San Francisco under their own power.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A mine</span> is a torpedo that has no motive-power of
its own but is either anchored or set adrift in the
supposed path of an enemy’s ship. We have already
seen how Bushnell used drifting mines at Philadelphia
in 1777. Anchored mines are among the many inventions
of Robert Fulton. The following description of
the original type, illustrated by an engraving made by
himself, is taken from Fulton’s “Torpedo War and Submarine
Explosions.”</p>

  <div class="caption">Fulton’s Anchored Torpedoes.</div></div>

<p>“Plate II represents the anchored torpedo, so arranged
as to blow up a vessel which should run against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
it; <i>B</i> is a copper case two feet long, twelve inches diameter,
capable of containing one hundred pounds of
powder. <i>A</i> is a brass box, in which there is a lock similar
to a common gun lock, with a barrel two inches
long, to contain a musket charge of powder: the box,
with the lock cocked and barrel charged, is screwed to
the copper case <i>B</i>. <i>H</i> is a lever which has a communication
to the lock inside of the box, and in its present
state holds the lock cocked and ready to fire. <i>C</i> is a
deal box filled with cork, and tied to the case <i>B</i>. The
object of the cork is to render the torpedo about fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
or twenty pounds specifically lighter than water, and
give it a tendency to rise to the surface. It is held down
to any given depth under water by a weight of fifty or
sixty pounds as at <i>F</i>: there is also a small anchor <i>G</i>, to
prevent a strong tide moving it from its position. With
torpedoes prepared, and knowing the depth of water
in all our bays and harbors, it is only necessary to fix
the weight <i>F</i> at such a distance from the torpedo, as
when thrown into the water, <i>F</i> will hold it ten, twelve, or
fifteen feet below the surface at low water, it will then be
more or less below the surface at high water, or at
different times of the tide; but it should never be so
deep as the usual draft of a frigate or ship-of-the-line.
When anchored, it will, during the flood tide, stand in its
present position; at slack water it will stand perpendicular
to the weight <i>F</i>, as at <i>D</i>; during the ebb it will be at <i>E</i>.
At ten feet under water the waves, in boisterous
weather, would have little or no tendency to disturb the
torpedo; for that if the hollow of a wave should sink
ten feet below what would be the calm surface, the wave
would run twenty feet high, which I believe is never the
case in any of our bays and harbors. All the experience
which I have on this kind of torpedo is, that in the
month of October, 1805, I had one of them anchored
nine feet under water, in the British Channel near Dover;
the weather was severe, the waves ran high, it kept its
position for twenty-four hours, and, when taken up, the
powder was dry and the lock in good order. The torpedo
thus anchored, it is obvious, that if a ship in sailing
should strike the lever <i>H</i>, the explosion would be instantaneous,
and she be immediately destroyed; hence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
to defend our bays or harbors, let a hundred, or more if
necessary, of these engines be anchored in the channel,
as for example, the Narrows, to defend New York.</p>

<p>“The figure to the right of the plate is an end view of
the torpedo. <i>H-H</i> shews its lever forked, to give the
better chance of being struck.</p>

<p>“Having described this instrument in a way which
I hope will be understood,” continues Fulton, “I may be
permitted to put the following question to my reader,
which is: Knowing that the explosion of one hundred
pounds of powder, or more if required, under the bottom
of a ship-of-the-line, would destroy her, and seeing,
that if a ship in sailing should strike the lever of an
anchored torpedo, she would be blown up, would he have
the courage, or shall I say the temerity, to sail into a
channel where one or more hundred of such engines were
anchored? I rely on each gentleman’s sense of prudence
and self-preservation, to answer this question to my satisfaction.
Should the apprehension of danger become as
strong on the minds of those who investigate this subject
as it is on mine, we may reasonably conclude that the
same regard to self-preservation will make an enemy cautious
in approaching waters where such engines are
placed; for however brave sailors may be, there is no
danger so distressing to the mind of a seaman, or so
calculated to destroy his confidence, as that which is invisible
and instantaneous destruction.”</p>

<p>But Admiral Farragut at Mobile Bay, half a century
later, did have the “temerity to sail into a channel where
one or more hundred of such engines were anchored.”
The monitor <i>Tecumseh</i> struck and exploded a mine that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
sent her to the bottom with almost her entire crew.
The rest of the fleet began to waver when, from the
main-rigging of the <i>Hartford</i> Farragut shouted his immortal
command:</p>

<p>“Full steam ahead! Damn the torpedoes!”</p>

<p>As the flagship led the way through the mine-field,
those on board heard mine after mine bump against her
bottom, but though the levers were struck and the primers
snapped, the powder-charges failed to explode. Hastily
improvised out of beer-kegs and other receptacles, with
tin or iron covers that became rusty and useless soon
after they were placed under water, many of the Confederate
mines were in this respect inferior to the well-built
copper torpedoes of Fulton. Yet crude as they
were, they destroyed more than forty Northern warships,
transports, and supply vessels.</p>

<p>Percussion-caps instead of flintlocks were now used
to explode contact mines. A new type of anchored
torpedo, set off by an electric spark through a wire running
to an operator on shore, was also a favorite with the
Confederates. Because they are exploded not by contact
with the ship’s hull but by the closing of the circuit by
the operator when he observes an enemy’s vessel to be
above one of them, these are called “observation mines.”
In the Civil War, many effective mines of this sort were
made out of whisky demijohns. One of these blew up
the gunboat <i>Cairo</i>, in the Yazoo River, in the autumn
of 1862. The double-ended, river gunboat <i>Commodore
Jones</i> was blown to pieces by an observation mine, whose
operator was subsequently captured and tied to the cut-water
of another Federal gunboat as a warning and a
hostage. During the bombardment of Fort Sumter by
the United States fleet in 1863, the <i>New Ironsides</i> lay
for an hour directly above an observation mine made of
boiler iron and containing a ton of gunpowder but which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
failed to explode despite all the efforts of the operator.
He was naturally accused of treachery and it would have
gone hard with him had it not been discovered, soon
after the <i>New Ironsides</i> ceased firing and stood out to
sea, that the shore end of the wire had been severed by
the wheel of an ammunition wagon.</p>

<p>During the Franco-Prussian War, the powerful French
fleet blockaded the German coast but did not attack the
shore batteries, which were well protected by mines.
After peace was declared the foreign consuls at one of
the North German seaports congratulated the burgomaster
on having planted and taken up so many mines without
a single accident. Unknown to any one, the prudent
burgomaster had unloaded them first, and they kept
the French away just as well.</p>

<p>In the Spanish-American War, Admiral Dewey was
able to enter Manila Bay and destroy the Spanish squadron
there because its commander “had repeatedly asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
for torpedoes (mines) from Madrid, but had received
none and his attempts to make them had been failures.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
It was the mine-fields and not the
feeble shore batteries that kept
Sampson’s fleet out of Havana and
Santiago. At Guantanamo, now a
United States naval station, the
<i>Texas</i> and the <i>Marblehead</i> each
“struck her propeller against a contact
mine, which failed to explode
only because it was incrusted with
a thick growth of barnacles. Gratitude
for the vessels’ escape may
fairly be divided between divine
care to which the gallant and devout
Captain Philip attributed it in his
report, and the Spaniards’ neglect
to maintain a proper inspection of
these defenses. A number of these
torpedoes, which were of French
manufacture, and contained forty-six
and a half kilograms (one hundred
and two pounds) of guncotton,
were afterward dragged up in the channel.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>At the siege of Port Arthur in 1904, the Japanese fleet
planted mines outside the harbor to keep the Russians in,
and the Russians came out and planted mines of their
own to entrap the blockaders. While engaged in this
work, the Russian mine-layer <i>Yenisei</i> had a mine which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
had just been lowered through her specially constructed
sternports thrown by a wave against her rudder, and
was blown to atoms by the consequent explosion of three
hundred more in her hold. The flagship <i>Petropavlosk</i>,
returning from a sortie on April 13, struck a Japanese contact-mine
and went down with the loss of six hundred
men, including Vereshchagin, the famous painter of war-scenes,
and Admiral Makaroff, who was not only the
commander but the heart and soul of the Russian fleet.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
A month later, another mine cost the Japanese their finest
battleship, the <i>Hatsuse</i>. Nor was the loss confined either
to the belligerents or to the duration of the war. Nearly
one hundred Chinese and other neutral merchant vessels
were sunk by some of the many mines torn loose from
their anchors by storms to drift, the least noticeable and
most terrible of derelicts, over all the seas of the Far
East, long after peace was declared.</p>

<p>The same thing on a larger scale will doubtless take
place as a result of the present European War. From
the Baltic to the Dardanelles, both sides have sown the
waters thick with contact mines, hundreds of which have
already broken loose and been cast up on the shores of
Denmark, Holland, and other neutral lands. How many
more have been picked up on the coasts of the different
belligerent countries, the military censors have naturally
kept a close secret; how many of these infernal machines
are now drifting about the North Sea, the North Atlantic,
and the Mediterranean it is impossible to compute.
Scarcely a week passes without the publication of such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
news items as the following extracts from “Current
events in Norway,” in the “American-Scandinavian Review”
for July-August, 1915:</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty mines had been brought into
Bergen up to April 12. The steamer <i>Caprivi</i> of Bergen,
which sank after being struck by a mine off the
coast of Ireland, was on its way from Baltimore with a
cargo of 4150 tons of grain, the property of the Norwegian
government.... The German government has
declared its willingness to comply with the demand of the
Norwegian government for compensation for the <i>Belridge</i>,
provided it be proved that the sinking of the
steamer was the result of a German torpedo. The pieces
of the shell found in the side of the vessel are to be sent
to the German government, and in case there should be
any disagreement about the facts they will be submitted
to arbitration.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately in most cases where a neutral ship is
so sunk, the exploding mine automatically destroys all
evidence of its own origin, and each belligerent promptly
and positively declares that it must have been planted,
if not deliberately set adrift, by the other side. The neutral
is left to get what satisfaction he can out of the ruling
of the last Hague Conference that all contact mines
must be so constructed as to become harmless after breaking
loose from their moorings. There is nothing mechanically
difficult about installing such a safety device,
and all the great powers now at war with each other
solemnly pledged themselves to do so. But the temptation
of perhaps destroying a hostile battleship as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
<i>Hatsuse</i> was destroyed, by a drifting mine, has apparently
been too great.</p>

<p>Premature explosion of the mine during handling and
planting, such as caused the destruction of the <i>Yenisei</i>
is, of course, carefully guarded against. One of the
simplest and most effective safety devices is that used in
the British navy, where the external parts of the exploding
apparatus are sealed with a thick layer of sugar,
which is dissolved by the sea-water after being submerged
for a few minutes. By then the mine-laying
vessel has had time to get safely out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Modern mines are of various shapes and sizes but are
as a rule either spherical or shaped like a pear with the
stem down. The anchor is a hollow, flat-bottomed cylinder,
containing its own anchor cable wound on a windlass,
and making a convenient base or stand for the explosive
chamber or mine proper, so that the whole apparatus
can be stood or trundled about the deck of a
mine-layer like a barrel. Once placed in the water either
by being dropped through the overhanging stern-ports
of a large sea-going mine-planter like the U.S.S. <i>San
Francisco</i>, or lowered over the side of a smaller craft
by a derrick boom, the weight of its anchor causes the
mine to assume an upright position. This releases a
small weight or plummet at the end of a short line attached
to a spring that keeps the windlass inside the
anchor from revolving. When the plummet has sunk to
the end of its cord, its weight pulls down the spring,
and the windlass begins to revolve and unreel the cable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the end of which is, of course, made fast to the bottom
of the mine. This causes the anchor, which has been
held up by the buoyancy of the mine, to sink, and follows
the plummet till the latter touches the bottom.
Freed of the plummet’s weight, the spring now flies up
and stops the windlass. But the hollow anchor is now
filled with water, whose additional weight drags the mine
under. When the anchor rests on the bottom, the mine
will be at the same distance beneath the surface of the
water as the anchor had to sink after the windlass
stopped, or the length of the plummet’s line. By regulating
that, a mine can be made automatically to set itself
at any desired depth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mines are almost never laid singly but in groups, the
area of water so planted being called a “mine field.”
A secret, zigzag channel is often left clear for the benefit
of friendly craft. The rows of mines are usually “staggered”
or placed like the men on a checker-board, so
that if a hostile vessel passes through an opening in the
first row she will strike a mine in the second. Another
device is to couple together the mooring cables of two
or more mines so that a ship passing between them will
draw them in against her sides.</p>

<p>Contact may cause explosion in any one of several
different ways. The head or sides of the mine may be
studded with projecting rods like the striker on the nose
of a Whitehead, to be either driven directly in against
a detonating charge of fulminate or else open the jaws
of a clutch and release the spring of a firing-pin. Such
external movable parts, however, are too prone to become
overgrown and clogged with barnacles and the like. A
more modern way is to have the shock of the collision
with the ship’s hull dislodge a heavy ball held in a cup
inside the mine. The fall of this weight sets in motion
machinery which fires the detonating charge. Or the
device may not be mechanical but electrical, as in the
type of mine that, when drawn far enough over to one
side by a vessel passing over it, spills a cupful of mercury.
This stream of liquid metal closes an electric circuit,
so that an electric current passes through a piece
of platinum wire embedded in fulminate and heats it red-hot,
with obvious results. This current may be obtained
either from a storage-battery carried in the mine itself,
or through a wire running down the mooring cable and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
over the bottom to the shore. Most shore-control mines
are so designed that they can either be fired by observation,
or else turned into electro-contact mines of the
above-mentioned type by arranging the switches in the
controlling station. It is also possible to have the contact
serve to warn the operator on shore by ringing a bell
and indicating the position of the intruding ship in the
mine-field.</p>

<p>Just as barbed-wire entanglements on land are blown
out of the way by small charges of high explosives, so
mined areas of the sea can be cleared by “counter-mining.”
One or more strings of linked-together mines, of
a small, easily-handled type, are carefully placed by light-draft
vessels in the waters already planted by the enemy.
When these are exploded together, the concussion is
enough to destroy any anchored mines near at hand,
either by setting off their exploding-devices or causing
their cases to leak, so that they will be filled with water
and sink harmlessly to the bottom. Or a channel may
be cleared by “sweeping” it with a drag-rope towed
along the bottom by two small steamers, exploding the
mines or tearing them up by the roots. Very effective
work of this kind has been done by the small steam-trawlers
used by the North Sea fishermen, and if anything
of the sort is ever necessary in American waters
we may be thankful for the powerful sea-going tugs now
towing strings of barges up and down our coasts.</p>

  <div class="caption">U. S. Mine-planter <i>San Francisco</i>.</div></div>

<p>But even a light field-piece on shore can shell and
sink the sort of small, unarmored craft that must be used
for mine-sweeping. When a fleet attacks a channel or
harbor entrance properly defended by both mine-fields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
and batteries, each supporting the other, there comes a
time when the naval forces must wait till troops can be
landed to drive away the forces protecting the rear of the
batteries, so that the mine-sweepers can advance and clear
a channel for the superdreadnoughts. The most striking
example of this is the holding of the Allied fleet by the
Turks at the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>There, too, effective use is being made of the latest,
which is an adaptation of the oldest type of torpedo: the
drifting mine.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> This twentieth-century improvement on
Bushnell’s “kegs charged with powder” floats upright,
with a vertical-acting propeller on top and another on its
bottom, and a hydrostatic valve set to maintain it at any
desired depth. Should it rise or sink, the change in pressure
will cause the valve to act on the principle already
explained in connection with the Whitehead torpedo (see
page <a href="#Page_44">44</a>). Controlled by the valve, the little compressed-air
motor attached to the vertical propellers will cause
them to make a few revolutions, just enough to keep the
mine at a constant depth beneath the surface of the
Dardanelles, as the four-mile-an-hour current carries it
down against the Anglo-French fleet. Within a few
hours of each other, during the furious bombardment
of the forts on March 18, 1915, the French battleship
<i>Bouvet</i> was struck by one of these drifting mines and
went down stern-foremost, then H.M.S. <i>Ocean</i> was sunk
by another, and the <i>Irresistible</i> forced to run ashore to
escape sinking, only to be pounded to pieces by the guns
of the forts. A feature of this type of mine is that its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
size and shape enable it to be launched through a torpedo
tube, either from a surface craft or from a submarine.</p>

<p>Ordinary contact-mines, without anchors and attached
to floats that held them a few feet below the surface of
the water, are sometimes dropped overboard from a
vessel closely pursued by an enemy. A small mine so
dropped by a German light cruiser returning from an
attempted raid on the English coast, early in the war,
was struck by the pursuing British submarine <i>D-5</i> and
sent her to the bottom. The <i>D-5</i> was running awash
at the time and only two officers and two seamen were
saved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> first submarine in history to sink a hostile
warship without also sinking herself is the <i>E-9</i> of
the British navy. Together with most of her consorts,
she was sent, at the outbreak of the present war, to explore
and reconnoiter off the German coast and the island
fortress of Heligoland to find where the enemy’s ships
were lying, how they were protected and how they might
be attacked. After six weeks of such work, the <i>E-9</i>
entered Heligoland Bight on September 13, 1914, and discharged
two torpedoes at the German light cruiser <i>Hela</i>.
One exploded against her bow and the other amidships,
and the cruiser went down almost immediately, drowning
many of her crew.</p>

  <div class="caption">English Submarine Rescuing English Sailors.</div></div>

<p>Another British submarine had already appeared in
action off Heligoland but as a saver instead of a destroyer
of human life. On the 28th of August a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of German torpedo-craft and light cruisers were decoyed
out to sea by the appearance and pretended flight of
some English destroyers. (It has been declared but not
officially confirmed that the “bait” consisted not of destroyers
but two British submarines, which rose to the
surface where one of them pretended to be disabled and
was slowly towed away by the other till their pursuers
were almost within range, when the line was cast off and
both boats dived to safety.) The Germans found themselves
attacked by a larger British flotilla and a confused
sort of battle followed. During the mêlée, an English
cruiser lowered a whaleboat that picked up several survivors
of a sunken German vessel. The cruiser was then
driven away by a more powerful German ship, and the
crew of the whaleboat found themselves left in the
enemy’s waters without arms, food, or navigating instruments.
Suddenly a periscope rose out of the water
alongside, followed by the conning-tower and hull of the
British submarine <i>E-4</i>, which took the Englishmen on
board and left the Germans the whaleboat, after which
both parties went home rejoicing.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the German submarine <i>U-15</i> boldly
attacked a British squadron, but revealed herself by the
white wake of her periscope as it cut through the calm
water. A beautifully aimed shot from the cruiser <i>Birmingham</i>
smashed the periscope. The submarine dived,
temporarily safe but blinded, for she was an old-fashioned
craft with only one observation instrument. Her
commander now essayed a swift “porpoise dive” up to
the surface and down again, exposing only the conning-tower
for a very few seconds. But a broadside blazed
from the <i>Birmingham</i>, a shell struck squarely against the
conning-tower, and the sea poured in through the ragged
death-wound in the deck of the <i>U-15</i>.</p>

But these early affairs were now overshadowed as completely
as the first Union victories in West Virginia were
overshadowed by Bull Run. Another British squadron
encountered another German submarine and this time
the periscope was not detected. Lieutenant-Commander
Otto von Weddigen had had ample time to take up an
ideal position beside the path of his enemies, who passed
in slow and stately procession before the bow torpedo-tubes
of the <i>U-9</i>. The German officer pressed a button
and saw through his periscope the white path of the
“Schwartzkopf” as it sped straight and true to the tall
side of the <i>Aboukir</i>. He saw the cruiser heaved into the
air by the shock of the bursting war-head, then watched
her settle and go down. Round swung her nearest consort
to the rescue, lowering her lifeboats as she came.
But scarcely had the survivors of the <i>Aboukir’s</i> company
set foot on the deck of the <i>Hogue</i> than she, too, was
torpedoed, and the half-naked men of both crews went
tumbling down the slope of the upturned side as she
rolled over and sank. Up steamed the <i>Cressy</i>, her gun-crews
standing by their useless pieces, splendid in helpless
bravery. Half reluctantly, von Weddigen sent his
remaining foe to the bottom and slipped away under the
waves, the victor of the strangest naval battle in history.</p>

<p>Not a German had received the slightest injury; fourteen
hundred Englishmen had been killed. It was the
loss of these trained officers and seamen, and not that of
three old cruisers that would soon have been sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
scrap heap, that was felt by the British navy. Realizing
that no fears for their own lives would keep the officers
of a British ship from attempting to rescue the drowning
crew of another, the Admiralty issued the following order:</p>

<p>“It has been necessary to point out for the future
guidance of his Majesty’s ships that the conditions that
prevail when one vessel of a squadron is injured in a
mine-field or exposed to submarine attack are analogous
to those which occur in an action and that the rule of
leaving disabled ships to their own resources is applicable,
so far at any rate as large vessels are concerned. No act
of humanity, whether to friend or foe, should lead to a
neglect of the proper precautions and dispositions of
war, and no measures can be taken to save life which
prejudice the military situation.”</p>

<p>Another old cruiser, the <i>Hermes</i>, that had been
turned into a floating base for sea-planes, was torpedoed
off Dunkirk by a German submarine, most of the crew
being rescued by French torpedo boats. On New Year’s
day, 1915, the battleship <i>Formidable</i> was likewise sent
to the bottom of the English Channel. She too was a
rather old ship, of the same class as the <i>Bulwark</i>, which
had been destroyed by an internal explosion two weeks
earlier in the Medway, and the <i>Irresistible</i>, afterwards
sunk by a mine in the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>But there was nothing small or old about the <i>Audacious</i>.
She was&mdash;or is&mdash;a 24,800 ton superdreadnought,
launched in 1911 and carrying ten thirteen-and-a-half-inch
guns. This stupendous war-engine was found
rolling helpless in the Irish Sea, her after compartments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
flooded by a great hole made either by a drifting mine
or, what is more likely considering its position, by a torpedo
from a German submarine. The White Star liner
<i>Olympic</i>, which had been summoned by wireless, took
the disabled warship in tow for several hours, after which
the <i>Audacious</i> was cast off and abandoned. A photograph
taken by one of the <i>Olympic’s</i> passengers and afterwards
widely circulated shows the huge ironclad down
by the stern, listing heavily to one side, and apparently
on the point of sinking. But her loss has never been admitted
by the British Admiralty, and it has been repeatedly
declared by reputable persons that the <i>Audacious</i>
was kept afloat till the <i>Olympic</i> was out of sight, and was
then towed by naval vessels into Belfast, where she was
drydocked and repaired at Harland and Wolff’s shipyard
to be sent back to the fighting line. Her fate is one of
the most interesting of the many mysteries of the war
and will probably not be made clear till peace has come.
The silence of the British Admiralty is explained by the
standing orders forbidding the revealing of the whereabouts
of any of his Majesty’s ships, particularly when
helpless and disabled. It should be noted in this connection
that the German government has never admitted the
loss of the battleship <i>Pommern</i> which the Russians insist
was sunk by one of their submarines in the Baltic.</p>

Because the overwhelming strength of the Allied fleet
has kept the German and Austrian battleships safely
locked up behind shore batteries, mine-fields and nettings,
the Allies’ submarines have had comparatively few targets
to try their skill on. The activity of the British
submarines in the North Sea at the outbreak of the war
has already been referred to, and a year later they found
another opportunity in the Baltic. There the German
fleet had the same preponderance over the Russian as the
English had over the German battleships in the North
Sea, but the British dreadnoughts could not be sent
through the long tortuous passage of the Skagerrack and
Cattegat, thick-sown with German mines, without cutting
the British fleet in half and giving the Germans a
splendid chance to defeat either half and then slip back
through the Kiel Canal and destroy the other. So England
sent some of her submarines instead. One of these
joined the Russian squadron defending the Gulf of Riga
against a German fleet and decided the fight by disabling
the great battle-cruiser <i>Moltke</i>. Another, the <i>E-13</i>, ran
ashore on the Danish island of Saltholm on August 19,
1915, and was warned by the commander of a Danish
torpedo-boat that she would be allowed twenty-four
hours to get off. Before the time-limit had expired and
while three Danish torpedo-boats were standing by, two
German destroyers steamed up, torpedoed the <i>E-13</i>, and
killed half her crew by gun-fire: an outrageous violation
of Denmark’s neutrality.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Daredevil deeds have been done by the submarines of
both sides in the Dardanelles. The little <i>B-11</i> swam up
the straits, threading her way through mine-field after
mine-field, her captain keeping his course by “dead-reckoning”
with map and compass and stop watch. To
have exposed his periscope would have drawn the fire
of the many shore batteries, to have dived a few feet too
far in those shallow waters would have meant running
aground, to have misjudged the swirling, changing currents
might have meant annihilation. But Commander
Holbrook brought his vessel safely through, torpedoed
and sank the guard-ship <i>Messudieh</i>, a Turkish ironclad
of the vintage of 1874, and returned to receive the Victoria
Cross from his king and a gigantic “Iron Cross”
from his brother officers. The <i>E-11</i> went up even to
Constantinople, torpedoed a Turkish transport within
sight of the city and threw the whole waterfront into a
panic. More transports and store-ships were sunk or
driven on shore in the Sea of Marmora, a gunboat was
torpedoed, and then the <i>Kheyr-el-din</i>, an old 10,000 ton
battleship that had been the <i>Kurfürst Freiderich Wilhelm</i>
before the kaiser sold her to Turkey, was sent to
the bottom of the same waters by British submarines.
One of them the <i>E-15</i> ran aground in the Dardanelles and
was forced to surrender to the Turks, but before they
could float her off and make use of her, two steam
launches dashed upstream through the fire of the shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
batteries and torpedoed the stranded submarine as Cushing
blew up the <i>Albemarle</i>.</p>

<p>But on the same day as the <i>E-11’s</i> first exploit&mdash;May
25, 1915, the British battleship <i>Triumph</i> went down
with most of her crew off Gallipoli, torpedoed by a German
submarine. The <i>U-51</i> had made the 2400 mile trip
from the North Sea, using as tenders a number of small
tank steamers flying the Spanish flag. These vessels intentionally
drew the attention of the cordon of British
destroyers drawn across the Straits of Gibraltar and
were captured, while the submarine swam safely through
and traversed the Mediterranean to the Dardanelles.
Two days after her first exploit, the <i>U-51</i> or perhaps
one of her Austrian consorts, sank another British battleship,
the <i>Majestic</i>, off Gallipoli. The <i>U-51</i> has been
reported sunk by Russian warships in the Black Sea.</p>

  <div class="caption">Tiny target afforded by Periscopes in rough weather.</div></div>

<p>If they could sink two battleships in three days, why
didn’t the German undersea boats sink a dozen or so
more and raise the siege of the Dardanelles? Enver
Pasha, the Turkish minister of war, declared that “the
presence of the submarines destroyed all hopes of Russia’s
ever effectively landing troops on the coast north
of Constantinople.” Then why did they permit the landing
of British, Australian, New Zealand, and French
troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula and the plains of
ancient Troy? It was not until August, 1915, that
the transport <i>Royal Edward</i> was sunk in the Mediterranean
by an Austrian submarine. Perhaps before this
war is over some British transport may be torpedoed in
the North Sea or the English Channel, but for more than
a year and a half since its outbreak, troop-ships and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a><a class="hidev" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
store-ships have been crossing to France as if there were
not a hostile “U-boat” in the world. Equally mysterious
has been the immunity of the light-draft monitors
and obsolescent gunboats off the Flemish coast, where
their heavy guns did so much to check the first German
drive on Calais, and have harassed the invaders’ right
flank ever since. Many of these are mere floating platforms
for one or two modern guns, all are slow-steaming,
and they are not always in water too shallow for an
undersea boat to swim in, yet none have been sunk by a
submarine since the loss of the <i>Hermes</i>, in the autumn of
1914. Zeebrugge, the Belgian port that has been made
the headquarters for German submarines in the North
Sea, has been several times bombarded by the British
fleet and, according to reports from Amsterdam, half-built
submarines on the shore there have been destroyed
by shell-fire. Why did the completed undersea boats in
the harbor fail to come out and torpedo or drive away the
attacking fleet? We have been shown what modern submarines
can do; what prevents them from doing much
more?</p>

<p>Shortly after von Weddigen’s great exploit, a German
submarine rose to the surface so near the British destroyer
<i>Badger</i> that before the undersea boat could submerge
again she was rammed, cut open and sunk. One
of the most picturesque and least expected features of
this war has been the revival of old ways; soldiers are
again wearing breastplates and metal helmets and fighting
with crossbows and catapults, while against the modern
submarine, seamen are effectively using the most ancient
of all naval weapons: the ram. It takes two minutes for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the average undersea boat to submerge, during which
time a thirty-knot destroyer can come charging up from
a mile away, with a good chance of scoring a hit with
her forward 3-&nbsp;or 4-inch gun, even if she gets there too
late to ram. In the case of the <i>U-12</i>, the submarine
dived deep enough to get her hull and superstructure out
of harm’s way, only to have the top of her conning-tower
crushed in by the destroyer as it passed over her.
When the inrush of water forced the <i>U-12</i> to rise to the
surface and surrender, her crew discovered that the main
hatch could not be opened because one of the periscopes
had been bent down across it. Some of them succeeded
in climbing out of the torpedo-hatch and jumping overboard
before the <i>U-12</i> went down for good. As she
sank stern-foremost, it was observed that both of her
bow-tubes were empty; evidence that she had vainly
launched two torpedoes at the British flotilla that were
hunting her down. Though several British destroyers
and torpedo-boats have been sent to the bottom by German
submarines, and the English <i>E-9</i> has sunk the German
destroyer <i>S-126</i>, yet the nimble surface torpedo-craft
have usually proved too difficult for the undersea
boats to hit with their fixed tubes that can only fire
straight ahead or astern.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out that the <i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Cressy</i> and
<i>Hogue</i>, the <i>Formidable</i>, and the <i>Audacious</i> were all moving
slowly and unescorted by any destroyers when they
were attacked and sunk. The same was true of the <i>Leon
Gambetta</i> and the <i>Giuseppe Garibaldi</i>, when they were
sent to the bottom of the Mediterranean by Austrian submarines.
Under modern conditions, such isolated big<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
ships are in much the same perilous position as would
have been a lonely battery of Union artillery marching
through a country swarming with Confederate cavalry.
While an escort of destroyers is no sure guarantee
against submarine attack, their presence certainly seems
to act as a powerful deterrent.</p>

<p>Waters suspected of containing hostile submarines are
swept, very much as they would be for mines, by pairs
of destroyers or steam trawlers, dragging an arrangement
of strong cables between them. Sometimes this is festooned
with explosives to blow in the side of any undersea
boat it may touch. Usually the vessels engaged in
this work use a large net. When they feel the weight
of a catch, it is said that they let go the ends and leave
it to the submarine’s own twin propellers to entangle
themselves thoroughly. An undersea boat so entrapped
is helpless to do anything but either sink or else empty
her tanks and try to rise and surrender. A submarine
in trouble usually sends up notification in the form of
large quantities of escaping oil and gas.</p>

<p>Inventors have been busy devising new kinds of traps,
snares, and exaggerated lobster-pots to be placed in the
waters about the British Isles. How many German submarines
have poked their noses into these devices probably
not even the British Admiralty could tell, if it was
so minded, but the traps are said to have been put down
very plentifully and most of the published designs are
extremely ingenious.</p>

<p>Individual torpedo-nets for ships have rather gone out
of fashion, but the most effective way of keeping submarines
out of a harbor is to close its entrance with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
booms and nettings. The principal naval bases on both
sides are undoubtedly so protected. It has been persistently
reported that the immunity of British transports
crossing the channel is due to a double line of booms, nets
and mines stretching from one shore to the other, and
enclosing a broad, safe channel outside which the “U-boats”
roam hungrily. There would seem to be no great
difficulty in building such a barrier, but it would be extremely
difficult to keep intact in heavy weather and for
that reason most of our naval officers are skeptical of its
existence.</p>

<p>Microphones which have been placed under water off
the coasts of France, Great Britain, and Ireland have
succeeded in detecting the presence of submarines at a
distance of fifty-five miles. This device has been perfected
by the joint labors of an American electrical engineer,
Mr. William Dubilier, and Professor Tissot of
the French Academy of Science. These two gentlemen,
experimenting with microphones and a submarine placed
at their disposal by the French government, “discovered
in the course of the tests that the underwater craft
were sources of sound waves of exceedingly high frequency,
quite distinctive from any other subaqueous
sounds. While the cause of the high-pitched sound is
known to the inventors, it cannot be divulged since it
would then be possible for German submarine constructors
to eliminate the source of the tell-tale sound waves,
and thus render void the purpose of the detector installation.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>These microphones, it is believed, are usually arranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in a semicircle. Each instrument records sound waves
best when they come from one particular direction. The
operator on shore, listening to a device that eliminates all
other sounds coming in from under the sea, can tell by
the way a passing submarine affects the different microphones
in the semicircle how far off and in what direction
it is moving, and so warns and summons the ever-watchful
patrol boats.</p>

<p>Air craft are doubtless being much used in the hunt
for submarines, for an aviator at a height of several
hundred feet can distinctly see a submarine swimming
beneath him in clear water with a good light reflected
from the bottom. Early in the war, the pilot and observer
of a “Taube” that was brought down in the
North Sea were rescued by a British submarine. In the
attack on Cuxhaven a combined force of submarines, sea-planes,
and light cruisers was resisted by the German
shore-batteries, destroyers, “U-boats”, aeroplanes and
Zeppelins. As the British sea-planes returned from
dropping bombs on the Cuxhaven navy yard or taking
observations above the Kiel Canal, some of them were
shot down by the Germans but the aviators were picked
up, as had been arranged beforehand, by English submarines.
In the spring of 1915 there was an engagement
between a Zeppelin and a British submarine in
which each side claimed the victory. On August 26
of the same year the secretary of the British Admiralty
announced:</p>

<p>“Squadron Commander Arthur Bigsworth, R.N., destroyed
single-handed a German submarine this morning
by bombs dropped from an aeroplane. The submarine
was observed to be completely wrecked, and sank off Ostend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
“It is not the practice of the Admiralty to publish
statements regarding the losses of German submarines,
important though they have been, in cases where the
enemy has no other source of information as to the time
and place at which these losses have occurred. In the
case referred to above, however, the brilliant feat of
Squadron Commander Bigsworth was performed in the
immediate neighborhood of the coast in occupation of the
enemy and the position of the sunken submarine has been
located by a German destroyer.”</p>

<p>“This is inexact,” replied the German Admiralty.
“The submarine was attacked but not hit and returned
to port undamaged. One of our submarines on August
16 destroyed by gunfire the benzol factory with the attached
benzol warehouses and coke furnaces near Harrington,
England. The statement of the English press
that the submarine attacked the open towns of Harrington,
Parton, and Whitehaven is inexact.”</p>

<p>Equally interesting but unfortunately lacking in details
are the reports from the Adriatic of submarines fighting
submarines. There have been three such duels, in
one an Austrian sank an Italian submarine, in another
the Italian was victorious, while after the third both
were found lying on the bottom, each torn open by the
other’s torpedo. As it is a physical impossibility for the
pilot of one submarine to see another under the water,
it would seem as if at least one of the combatants in
each of these fights must have been running on the surface
at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Both Mr. Simon Lake and the late John P. Holland
were absolutely confident that submarines could not fight
submarines, that surface craft would be utterly unable
to injure or resist them, and that therefore the submarine
boat would make naval warfare impossible and do
more than anything else to bring about permanent
peace.</p>

<p>All that can be said at present is that the actual situation
is much more complex than had been expected.
Submarines have sunk many surface warships but have
suffered heavily themselves. The German government
has admitted the loss of over a dozen “U-boats,” while
the unofficial estimates of their enemies’ run as high as
thirty-five or fifty German submarines destroyed or captured.
Admiral Beatty’s victorious squadron, pursuing
the German battle-cruisers after the second North Sea
fight, turned and retreated at the wake of a single torpedo
and the glimpse of hostile periscopes. But the submarine
has not yet driven the surface warship from the
seas and it has signally failed against transports. Its
moral effect has been very great: British submarines have
terrorized the citizens of Constantinople; while the victories
of their beloved “U-boats” have cheered the German
people as the victories of our frigates cheered us
in 1812, and have been a somewhat similar shock to the
nerves of the British navy. But that sturdy organization
has recovered from more than one attack of nerves.
And as the war goes on, it becomes increasingly clear
that it is unfair to expect unsupported submarines, any
more than unsupported frigates a century ago, to do the
work of an entire navy. Like the aeroplane, the submarine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
was first derided as useless, next hailed as a complete
substitute for all other arms, then found to be an
indispensable auxiliary, whose scope and value are now
being determined.</p>

Being the Log of Captain John Sirius<br />

</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> you have not read the above-mentioned story by the
author of Sherlock Holmes, I advise you to go to the
nearest public library and ask for it. For those that
cannot spare the time to do this, here are a brief outline
and a few quotations.</p>

<p>Captain John Sirius is supposed to be chief of submarines
in the navy of Norland, a small European kingdom
at war with England. With only eight submarines,
he establishes a blockade of Great Britain and begins
sinking all ships bringing in food. He enters a French
harbor, though France is at peace with his country, and
sinks three British ships that have taken refuge there.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” says the captain, “they thought they
were safe in French waters but what did I care about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
three-mile limits and international law! The view of
my government was that England was blockaded, food
contraband, and vessels carrying it to be destroyed. The
lawyers could argue about it afterwards. My business
was to starve the enemy any way I could.”</p>

<p>Presently he overtook an American ship and sank her
by gunfire as her skipper shouted protests over the rail.</p>

<p>“It was all the same to me what flag she flew so long
as she was engaged in carrying contraband of war to the
British Isles.... Of course I knew there would be a
big row afterwards and there was.”</p>

<p>“The terror I had caused had cleared the Channel.”</p>

<p>“There was talk of a British invasion (of Norland)
but I knew this to be absolute nonsense, for the British
had learned by this time that it would be sheer murder
to send transports full of soldiers to sea in the face of
submarines. When they have a Channel tunnel, they
can use their fine expeditionary force upon the Continent
but until then it might not exist so far as Europe is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Heavens, what would England have done against a
foe with thirty or forty submarines?”</p>

<p>The British navy could do nothing to stop Captain
John Sirius. One of his submarines was sunk by an
armed liner, but with the remaining seven he sank the
<i>Olympic</i> and so many other vessels that no one dared
try to bring food into Great Britain. At the end of six
weeks, fifty thousand people there had died of starvation
and the British government had to make peace with Norland
and pay for all the damage the submarines had
done to neutrals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
As a warning to his countrymen, Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle wrote this story in May, 1914. Before it was
published,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> England was at war with Germany. On
February 4, 1915, the famous “War Zone Decree” was
published in Berlin.</p>

<p>“The waters around Great Britain, including the
whole of the English Channel, are declared hereby to be
included within the zone of war, and after the 18th inst,
all enemy merchant vessels encountered in these waters
will be destroyed, even if it may not be possible always
to save their crews and passengers.</p>

<p>“Within this war-zone neutral vessels are exposed to
danger since, in view of the misuse of the neutral flags
ordered by the government of Great Britain on the 31st
ult., and of the hazards of naval warfare, neutral ships
cannot always be prevented from suffering from the attacks
intended for enemy ships.</p>

<p>“The routes of navigation around the north of the
Shetland Islands in the eastern part of the North Sea
and in a strip thirty miles wide along the Dutch coast
are not open to the danger-zone.”</p>

<p>But those routes had been closed three months before
by the British government, which declared that it had
had the North Sea planted with anchored contact mines,
but that all ships trading to neutral ports would, if they
first called at some British port, be given safe conduct to
Holland or Scandinavia, by way of the English Channel.
This way would run through the proposed “war-zone.”</p>

<p>International law says nothing about either “war-zones”
or submarines. In all probability, special rules<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
for undersea warfare will be drawn up by a conference
of delegates from the leading countries of the world
soon after the end of the present war. But till then,
no such conference can be held, and the United States
has always maintained, even when it has been to its disadvantage
to do so, that no one nation can change international
law to suit herself. We insist that the game
be played according to the rules. A submarine has no
more rights than any other warship. It may sink a merchantman
if the latter tries to fight or escape. If the
captured vessel is found to be carrying contraband to the
enemy’s country, the warship may either take her into
port as a prize or, if this is impracticable, sink her. But
before an unarmed and unresisting merchant vessel can
be sunk, the passengers and crew must be given time and
opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>President Wilson gave notice on February 10, 1915,
that if, by act of the commander of any German warship,
an American vessel or the lives of American citizens
should be lost on the high seas, the United States “would
be constrained to hold the Imperial government of Germany
to a strict accountability for such acts of their
naval authorities and to take any steps that might be
necessary to safeguard American lives and property and
to secure to American citizens the full enjoyments of
their acknowledged rights on the high seas.”</p>

<p>On the same day, a note to Great Britain voiced our
objection to the “explicit sanction by a belligerent government
for its merchant ships generally to fly the flag
of a neutral power within certain portions of the high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
seas which are presumed to be frequented with hostile
warships.”</p>

<p>To this Sir Edward Grey replied that “the British
government have no intention of advising their merchant
shipping to use foreign flags as a general practice or resort
to them otherwise than for escaping capture or destruction.”</p>

<p>Such “sailing under false colors” to fool the enemy’s
cruisers is an old and well-established right of merchantmen
of belligerent countries. Its abuse, under present-day
conditions, however, might have given the German
submarine commanders a plausible excuse for sinking
neutral vessels. To avoid this, neutral shipowners began
to paint the name, port, and national colors on the
broadside of each of their steamers, plain enough to be
read from afar through a periscope.</p>

<p>Then the time came for the war-zone decree to be put
into effect, and the world watched with great interest
and no little apprehension to see what the submarine
blockaders could do.</p>

<p>Seven British ships were sunk during the first six days.
Then came a lull, followed by the announcement by the
British Admiralty that between February 23 to March 3,
3805 transoceanic ships had arrived at British ports, 669
had cleared and none had been lost, while two German
submarines had been sunk. During the eleven weeks between
the establishing of the blockade and the sinking of
the <i>Lusitania</i>, forty-two oversea vessels and twenty-eight
fishing boats of British registry had been sunk by the
submarines, but 16,190 liners and freighters had safely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
run the blockade. The largest number of vessels sunk
by the “U-boats” in any one week was thirty-six, between
June 23 and 30; while nineteen British merchantmen,
with a total tonnage of 76,000, and three fishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
vessels were destroyed either by submarines or mines
during the week ending August 25. The total number
sunk in the first six months was 485. But with more
than fifteen hundred ships coming and going every week,
the submarine blockade of the British Isles was obviously
a failure.</p>

<p>It was a costly failure from the military point of
view. The expenditure of torpedoes alone must have
been considerable and a modern Whitehead or Schwartzkopf
costs from five to eight thousand dollars and takes
several months to build. How many of the “U-boats”
themselves have fallen prey to the British patroling craft,
traps, mines, and drag-nets cannot be computed with any
accuracy, but by the first of September, 1915, the number
declared to be lost “on the authority of a high official
in the British Admiralty” ran anywhere from
thirty to fifty. Even if she has been completing a new
submarine every week since the war began, Germany
cannot afford the loss of so much material, and still, less,
of so many trained men. Captain Persius, one of the
foremost German writers on naval affairs, pointed this
out in a newspaper article that brought a hurricane of
angry criticism about his ears. How great has been the
wear and tear on the nervous systems of the submarine
crews is shown by the following extract from the statement
of Captain Hansen of the captured <i>U-16</i>.</p>

<p>“It is fearfully trying on the nerves. Not every man
can endure it. While running under the sea there is
deathlike stillness in the boats, as the electrical machinery
is noiseless.... As the air becomes heated it gets poor
and mixed with the odor of oil from the machinery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
The atmosphere becomes fearful. An overpowering
sleepiness often attacks new men and one requires the
utmost will power to keep awake. I have had men who
did not want to eat during the first three days out because
they did not want to lose that amount of time from
sleep. Day after day spent in such cramped quarters,
where there is hardly room to stretch your legs, and remaining
constantly on the alert, is a tremendous strain
on the nerves.”</p>

<p>But if there is discomfort below the surface there is
peril of death above. Yet a submarine must spend as
much time as possible on top of the water, even off the
enemy’s coast, to spare the precious storage batteries and
let the Diesel engines grind oil into electricity by using
the electric motor as a dynamo. If she could renew her
batteries under water or pick up a useable supply of current
as she can pick up a drum of oil from a given spot
on the sea-bottom, then the modern submarine would indeed
be a hard fish to catch. As it is, great ingenuity
has been shown by the German skippers in minimizing
the dangers of surface cruising and at the same time
stalking their prey. One big submarine masqueraded
as a steamer, with dummy masts and funnel. Innocent-looking
steam trawlers flying neutral flags acted as
screens and lookouts, besides carrying supplies. One of
these boldly entered a British harbor, where it was noticed
that her decks were cumbered with very many coils
of rope. The authorities investigated and found snugly
stowed in the center of each a large can of fuel-oil. Another
trawler, flying the Dutch flag, was stopped in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
North Sea by a British cruiser and searched by a boarding-party.
They were going back into their boat, after
finding everything apparently as it should be, when one
of the Englishmen noticed a mysterious pipe sticking
out of the trawler’s side. They swarmed on board
again and discovered that the fishing-boat had a complete
double hull, the space between being filled with oil. The
trawler’s crew were removed to the cruiser and a strong
detachment of bluejackets left in their place. A few
hours afterwards, there was a swirl of water alongside
and a German submarine came up for refreshments.
It was promptly captured and so was another that presently
followed it: a good day’s catch for one small fishing-boat.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty and danger of depending
on underwater caches and tenders, each blockader usually
returned at the end of two or three weeks to Heligoland,
Zeebruge, Ostend, or some other base to take on supplies,
report progress and rest the crew. This of course
reduces the number of submarines actually on guard.
How large that number may have been at any particular
time since the blockade began is unknown to everybody
except a few persons in Berlin. At the outbreak of the
war, Germany had between twenty and twenty-five submarines
in commission and a dozen or so under construction.
If, as is claimed, the Germans have been completing
a new undersea boat every week since the war began,
that would have given them by August 1, 1915, a flotilla
of seventy-seven, exclusive of losses. If only thirty had
been lost, that would have left fewer than fifty submarines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
to blockade more than fifty seaports, great and
small, scattered over more than twenty-five hundred miles
of coast.</p>

<p>Moreover, these widely scattered blockaders would
have to be on duty by night as well as by day. But at
night or in fog the periscope is useless; to intercept an
incoming steamer, running swiftly and without lights,
the submarine must rise and cruise on the surface. It
cannot use a searchlight to locate the blockade-runner
without consuming much precious voltage and at the
same time attracting the nearest patrol-boat.</p>

<p>The same disadvantages apply to sending wireless messages
from one blockading submarine to another. And
as the wireless apparatus of an undersea boat is necessarily
low-powered and has a narrow radius, while “oscillators,”
bells, and other underwater signaling devices
are still in their infancy, it would seem as if the German
“U-boats” in British waters must have been suffering
from lack of coöperation and team-play. If the captain
of a Union gunboat, lying off Charleston during the Civil
War, caught a glimpse of a blockade runner, he could
alarm the rest of the fleet with rockets and signal guns,
but the commander of the <i>U-99</i> off Queenstown cannot
count on his consorts if he himself fails to sink an approaching
liner.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most notable shortcoming of the submarine
blockade has been its failure to inspire terror. Contrary
to the expectations of nearly every forecaster from
Robert Fulton to Conan Doyle, the sinking of the first
merchant vessels by submarines failed to frighten away
any others. Cargo rates are high in war-time and insurance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
covers the owners’ risk, so few sailing orders
were canceled. As for the captains, they are not noted
for timidity, and professional pride is strong among
them; most of them have families to provide for, and
every one of them knows that behind him stands an
eager young mate with a master’s ticket, ready to take
the risk and take out the ship if the skipper quits. So
the merchant marine accepted the submarine as one of
the risks of the trade.</p>

<p>When a big German submarine rose up off the Irish
coast within easy gunshot of the homeward-bound
British steamer <i>Anglo-Californian</i> and signaled for her
to heave to, the plucky English skipper slammed his engine-room
telegraph over to “Full speed ahead.” Away
dashed the steamer and after her came the submarine,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
making good practice with her 8.8 centimeter gun.
Twenty shrapnel shells burst over the <i>Anglo-Californian</i>,
riddling her upper works, slaughtering thirty of her
cargo of horses, killing seven of her crew and wounding
eight more. Steering with his own hands, Captain
Archibald Panlow held his vessel on her course till a
shrapnel bullet killed him, when the wheel was taken by
his son, the second mate, who brought the <i>Anglo-Californian</i>
safely into Queenstown. It is men of this breed
who have kept Admiral von Tirpitz from saying, in the
words of the fictitious Captain John Sirius,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
“The terror I had caused had cleared the channel.”</p>

<p>But because the “Campaign of Frightfulness” has
failed and a few score of unsupported submarines have
been unable to blockade the British Isles, it is stupid to
pretend that there has been no progress since 1901 and
say as Admiral von Tirpitz said then,</p>

<p>“Submarines are as useless as ever.”</p>

<p>Like every other type of naval craft, submarines are
useful but not omnipotent. We have seen what they can
do in action and what they have failed to do. As
scouts in the enemy’s waters they are invaluable. As
commerce destroyers, they do the work of the swift-sailing
privateers of a century ago. In the fall of 1915,
British submarines in the Baltic almost put a stop to the
trade between Germany and Sweden. But to blockade
a coast effectively, submarines must have tenders, which
must have destroyers and light cruisers to defend them,
which in turn require the support of battle-cruisers and
dreadnoughts, with their attendant host of colliers, hospital
ships and air-scouts. Nor can a coast be long defended
by submarines, mine-fields and shore-batteries, if
there are not enough trained troops to keep the enemy,
who can always land at some remote spot, from marching
round to the rear of the coast-defenses. This war
is simply repeating the old, old lesson that there are no
cheap and easy substitutes for a real army and a real
navy.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUBMARINE AND NEUTRALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Both</span> Admiral von Tirpitz and the Austrian Admiralty
seem to have begun their submarine campaigns
after the method of Captain John Sirius: to starve
the enemy any way they could and let the lawyers argue
about it afterwards. From the beginning of the blockade,
Scandinavian, Dutch, and Spanish vessels, even when
bound from one neutral port to another, were torpedoed
and sunk without warning by the German submarines.
Their governments protested vigorously but without effect.
Then came the turn of the United States.</p>

<p>The <i>Falaba</i>, a small British passenger steamer outward
bound from Liverpool to the west coast of Africa was
pursued and overtaken off the coast of Wales on March
28, 1915, by the fast German submarine <i>U-28</i>. Realizing
that their vessel would be sunk but expecting that
their lives would be spared, the crew and passengers began
filling and lowering away the boats as rapidly as possible
but without panic. The wireless operator had been
sending calls for help but ceased when ordered to by the
captain of the <i>U-28</i>. No patrol boats were in sight and
the submarine was standing by on the surface, with both
gun and torpedo-tubes trained on the motionless steamer
and in absolute command of the situation. Without the
slightest excuse or warning, a torpedo was then discharged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
and exploded against the <i>Falaba’s</i> side, directly
beneath a half-lowered and crowded lifeboat. The lifeboat
was blown to pieces and the steamer sunk, with the
loss of one hundred and twelve lives, including that of
an American citizen, Mr. Leon C. Thrasher, of Hardwick,
Massachusetts.</p>

  <div class="caption">British Submarine, showing one type of disappearing deck-gun
     now in use.</div></div>

<p>This cold-blooded slaughter of the helpless horrified
the rest of the world and did Germany’s cause an incalculable
amount of harm. The German people were
in no state of mind to realize this, for they had gone
literally submarine-mad. They rejoiced in the cartoons
depicting John Bull marooned on his island or dragged
under and drowned by the swarming “U-boats.” They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
sincerely believed that within a few months the power of
the British navy would be broken forever and that in the
meanwhile the German submarines could do no wrong.
This feeling was presently intensified by the loss of their
hero, the gallant von Weddigen. Decorated, together
with every man of his crew, with the Iron Cross and promoted
to the command of a fine new submarine, the
<i>U-29</i>, he did effective work as a blockader and captured
and sank several prizes, but only after carefully removing
those on board. Then the <i>U-29</i> was sunk with all
hands, by an armed patrol boat, the British declare:
treacherously, the German people believe, by a merchant
ship whose crew von Weddigen was trying to
spare.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>No attempt was made to warn the American tank
steamer <i>Gulflight</i>, bound for Rouen, France, with a contraband
cargo of oil, when she was torpedoed by a German
submarine on May 1. The vessel stayed afloat but
the wireless operator and one of the sailors, terrified by
the shock, jumped overboard and were both drowned,
while the captain died of heart failure a few hours later
on board the British patrol boat that took off the crew
and brought the <i>Gulflight</i> into port.</p>

<p>On the same day that the <i>Gulflight</i> was torpedoed,
these two advertisements appeared together in the New
York newspapers:</p>

<p class="newpage">This warning was not taken seriously. It was pointed
out that the German submarines had sunk only comparatively
small and slow steamers, and generally believed
that it would be impossible for them to hit a fast-moving
vessel. Not a single passenger canceled his passage
on the <i>Lusitania</i>, though all admitted that the Germans
would have a perfect right to sink her if they
could, as she was laden with rifle-cartridges and shell-cases
for the Allies. But every passenger knew that he
had a perfect right to be taken off first, and trusted to
the Government that had given him his passports to
maintain it.</p>

<p>The <i>Lusitania</i> left New York on the first of May. At
two o’clock on the afternoon of Friday, May 7, she was
about ten miles from the Irish coast, off the Old Head
of Kinsale, and running slowly to avoid reaching Queenstown
at an unfavorable turn of the tide, when Captain
Turner and many others saw a periscope rise out of the
water about half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I saw a torpedo speeding toward us,” declared the
captain afterwards, “and immediately I tried to change
our course, but was unable to manœuver out of the way.
There was a terrible impact as the torpedo struck the
starboard side of the vessel, and a second torpedo followed
almost immediately. This one struck squarely
over the boilers.</p>

<p>“I tried to turn the <i>Lusitania</i> shoreward, hoping to
beach her, but her engines were crippled and it was impossible.</p>

<p>“There has been some criticism because I did not
order the lifeboats out sooner, but no matter what may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
be done there are always some to criticize. Until the
<i>Lusitania</i> came to a standstill it was absolutely impossible
to launch the boats&mdash;they would have been
swamped.”</p>

<p>The great ship heeled over to port so rapidly that by
the time she could be brought to a stop it was no longer
possible to lower the boats on the starboard side. There
was no panic-stricken rush for the boats that could be
lowered; all was order and seemliness and quiet heroism.
Alfred Vanderbilt stripped off the lifebelt that might
have saved him and buckled it about a woman; Lindon
Bates, Jr., was last seen trying to save three children.
Elbert Hubbard, Charles Klein, Justus Miles Forman,
and more than a hundred other Americans died, and died
bravely. As the <i>Lusitania</i> went down beneath them,
Charles Frohman smiled at his companion and said:</p>

<p>“Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure
of life.”</p>

<p>“I turned around to watch the great ship heel over,”
said a passenger who had dived overboard and swum to
a safe distance.</p>

<p>“The monster took a sudden plunge, and I saw a
crowd still on her decks, and boats filled with helpless
women and children glued to her side. I sickened with
horror at the sight.</p>

<p>“There was a thunderous roar, as of the collapse
of a great building on fire; then she disappeared, dragging
with her hundreds of fellow-creatures into the vortex.
Many never rose to the surface, but the sea rapidly
grew thick with the figures of struggling men and
women and children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The total number of deaths was more than a thousand.</p>

<p>The most fitting comment on the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>
were the words of Tinkling Cloud, a full-blooded
Sioux Indian:</p>

<p>“Now you white men can never call us red men savages
again.”</p>

<p>Resting its case on “Many sacred principles of justice
and humanity,” refusing to accept the warning published
in the advertising columns of the newspapers by the
German embassy either “as an excuse or palliation,” and
assuming that the commanders of submarines guilty of
torpedoing without warning vessels carrying non-combatants
had acted “under a misapprehension of orders,”
the United States concluded its note to Germany, six
days after the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, with these words
of warning:</p>

<p>“The Imperial German government will not expect
the government of the United States to omit any word
or act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of
maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens
and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.”</p>

<p>Before any reply had been made to this, a German
submarine torpedoed without warning the American
freight steamer <i>Nebraskan</i>, on May 25, a few hours
after she had left Liverpool in ballast for the United
States. Fortunately no lives were lost, and although
the <i>Nebraskan’s</i> bows had been blown wide open by the
explosion, she remained afloat and was brought back to
Liverpool under her own steam. The attack was tardily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
admitted by Germany and explained by the fact that it
had been made at dusk, when the commander of the submarine
had been unable to recognize the steamer’s nationality.</p>

<p>On the last day of May, Germany’s answer was received.
The Imperial government declared that the
<i>Lusitania</i> had not been an unarmed merchantman but an
auxiliary cruiser of the British navy. That she had had
masked guns mounted on her lower deck, that she had
Canadian troops among her passengers, and that in violation
of American law she had been laden with high
explosives which were the real cause of her destruction
because they were set off by the detonation of the single
torpedo that had been discharged by the submarine.</p>

<p>To these allegations, unaccompanied by the slightest
proof and contradicted by the testimony both of British
and American eye-witnesses, the United States replied
calmly and categorically. It was pointed out that if the
German ambassador at Washington or the German consul
at New York had complained to the Federal authorities
before the <i>Lusitania</i> sailed and either guns or troops
had been found concealed on her, she would have been
interned. The statement of Mr. Dudley Field Malone,
collector of the Port of New York, that the <i>Lusitania</i>
was not armed, may be accepted as final. Gustav Stahl,
the German reservist who signed an affidavit that he had
seen guns on board her, later pleaded guilty to a charge
of perjury and was sentenced to eighteen months in a
Federal penitentiary. As for her cargo, every passenger
train and steamer in this country is allowed to transport
boxes of revolver and rifle cartridges&mdash;the only explosives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
carried on the <i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;because it is extremely
difficult to set off any number of them together,
either by heat or concussion.</p>

<p>Dropping these points, Germany then pledged the
safety of American ships in the war zone, if distinctly
marked, and to facilitate American travel offered to permit
the United States to hoist its flag on four belligerent
passenger steamers. This, if accepted, would by implication
have made Americans fair game anywhere else
on the high seas, and was accordingly rejected in the
strong American note of July 21.</p>

<p>“The rights of neutrals in time of war,” declared
President Wilson through the medium of Secretary Lansing,
“are based upon principle, not upon expediency,
and the principles are immutable. It is the duty and
obligation of belligerents to find a way to adapt the new
circumstances to them.</p>

<p>“The events of the past two months have clearly indicated
that it is possible and practicable to conduct such
submarine operations as have characterized the activity
of the Imperial German naval commanders within the
so-called war-zone in substantial accord with the accepted
practices of regulated warfare. The whole world has
looked with interest and increasing satisfaction at the
demonstration of that possibility by German naval commanders.
It is manifestly possible, therefore, to lift
the whole practice of submarine attack above the criticism
which it has aroused and remove the chief causes
of offense.”</p>

<p>Repetition by the commanders of German naval vessels
of acts contravening neutral rights “must be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
by the Government of the United States, where
they effect American citizens, as deliberately unfriendly.”</p>

<p>On July 9, a German submarine discharged a torpedo
at the west-bound Cunard liner <i>Orduna</i>, narrowly
missed her, rose to the surface and fired some twenty
shells before the steamer got out of range. Fortunately,
none of these took effect. There were American passengers
on board and nothing but bad marksmanship
averted another <i>Lusitania</i> horror.</p>

<p>Three days later, another German submarine stopped
an American freight steamer, the <i>Leelanlaw</i>, and had her
visited and searched by a boarding party, who reported
that she was carrying contraband to Great Britain. Because
the vessel could not be taken into a German port
and there was no time to throw her cargo overboard,
the crew were taken off and she was sunk.</p>

<p>Here was a perfectly proper procedure, where no neutral
lives had been endangered and the question of the
damage to property could be settled amicably in a court
of law. It was to the practice in the <i>Leelanlaw</i> case
that President Wilson referred to so hopefully in his
note of July 21. Though the weeks went by without any
answer from Germany, it was hoped that the Imperial
government had quietly amended the orders to its submarine
commanders and that no more passenger ships
would be attacked without warning.</p>

<p>But on the 19th of August, the White Star liner
<i>Arabic</i> sighted and went to the rescue of a sinking ship.
This proved to be the British steamer <i>Dunsley</i>, which
had been torpedoed by a German submarine. As the
<i>Arabic</i> came up and prepared to lower her boats, another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
torpedo from the same submarine exploded against
the liner’s side, killing several of her crew and sending
her to the bottom in eleven minutes. She went down
within fifty miles of the resting place of the <i>Lusitania</i>.
She was sunk without warning and without cause, for
she had been bound to New York, with neither arms nor
ammunition on board, nor had she made the slightest attempt
either to escape or attack the submarine. She
carried one hundred and eighty-one passengers, twenty-five
of whom were Americans. Two Americans were
drowned.</p>

<p>The German government at once asked for time in
which to explain, and the Imperial chancellor hinted that
the commander of the submarine that sank the <i>Arabic</i>
might have “gone beyond his instructions, in which case
the Imperial government would not hesitate to give such
complete satisfaction to the United States as would conform
to the friendly relations existing between both
governments.”</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing on the first of September,
when Ambassador von Bernstorff declared himself authorized
to say to the State Department that:</p>

<p>“Liners will not be sunk by our submarines without
warning and without safety of the lives of non-combatants,
provided that the liners do not try to escape or
offer resistance.”</p>

<p>But only three days afterwards, the west-bound
Canadian liner <i>Hesperian</i> was sunk by the explosion of
what seemed to have been a torpedo launched without
warning from a hostile submarine. And on top of this
disturbing incident came the German note on the sinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of the <i>Arabic</i>, the perusal of which sent a chill
through every peace-lover in America. Affirming that
the captain of the <i>Arabic</i> had tried to ram the submarine,
the note declared that orders had been issued to commanders
of German submarines not to sink liners without
provocation, but added that if by mistake or otherwise
liners were sunk without provocation, Germany
would not be responsible.</p>

<p>“The German government,” it ran, “is unable to acknowledge
any obligation to grant indemnity in the matter,
even if the commander should have been mistaken as
to the aggressive intention of the <i>Arabic</i>.</p>

<p>“If it should prove to be the case that it is impossible
for the German and American governments to reach a
harmonious opinion on this point, the German government
would be prepared to submit the difference of opinion,
as being a question of international law, to The
Hague Tribunal for arbitration....</p>

<p>“In so doing, it assumes that, as matter of course, the
arbitral decision shall not be admitted to have the importance
of a general decision on the permissibility ...
under international law of German submarine warfare.”</p>

<p>Assuming that this extraordinary stand was based on
a misapprehension of the facts, the United States submitted
to Germany the testimony of American passengers
on the <i>Arabic</i>, and the sworn affidavits of her
officers, that the submarine had not been sighted from
the steamer and that no attempt had been made to ram
the undersea boat or do anything but rescue the crew
of the <i>Dunsley</i>.</p>

<p>By this time a change had come over the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Imperial German government. It realized that the submarine
blockade of the British Isles had broken down,
and that further examples of “Frightfulness” on the
high seas would do Germany no good and would probably
force the United States into the ranks of Germany’s
enemies. The sensible and obvious thing to do was to
take the easy and honorable way out the American government
was holding open. On October 6, Ambassador
von Bernstorff gave out the following statement:</p>

<p>“Prompted by the desire to reach a satisfactory agreement
with regard to the <i>Arabic</i> incident, my government
has given me the following instructions:</p>

<p>“The order issued by His Majesty the Emperor to
the commanders of the German submarines, of which I
notified you on a previous occasion, has been made so
stringent that the recurrence of incidents similar to the
<i>Arabic</i> case is considered out of the question.</p>

<p>“According to the report of Commander Schneider of
the submarine which sank the <i>Arabic</i>, and his affidavit,
as well as those of his men, Commander Schneider was
convinced that the <i>Arabic</i> intended to ram the submarine.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the Imperial government does
not doubt the good faith of the affidavit of the British
officers of the <i>Arabic</i>, according to which the <i>Arabic</i>
did not intend to ram the submarine. The attack of the
submarine was undertaken against the instructions issued
to the commander. The Imperial government regrets
and disavows this act, and has notified Commander
Schneider accordingly.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, my government is prepared
to pay an indemnity for American lives which, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
its deep regret, have been lost on the <i>Arabic</i>. I am authorized
to negotiate with you about the amount of this
indemnity.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, fragments of the metal box of high
explosives that had blown in the side of the <i>Hesperian</i>
had been picked up on her deck, and forwarded by the
British government to America. United States naval
experts examined the twisted bits of metal and declared
them to have been pieces, not of a mine, as the German
government insists, but of an automobile torpedo.
However, in view of the fact that the <i>Hesperian</i> was
armed with a 4.7 gun, and because of the happy outcome
of the <i>Arabic</i> affair, it seems unlikely that anything will
be done about it.</p>

<p>But only a month later there was begun another
“Campaign of Frightfulness,” this time by Austrian
submarines in the Mediterranean. As the passengers on
the Italian liner <i>Ancona</i>, one day out from Naples to
New York, were sitting at luncheon on November 7th,
they “felt a tremor through the ship as her engines
stopped and reversed.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Then, while we were stopping,
there was an explosion forward. A shell had struck us.</p>

<p>“When I reached the deck,” continues Dr. Greil,
“shell was fairly pouring into us from the submarine,
which we could see through the fog, about 100 yards
away. I hurried below to pack a few things in my
trunk. As I was standing over it, a shell came through
the porthole and struck my maid, who was standing at
my side. It tore away her scalp and part of her skull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and went on through the wall, bursting somewhere inside
the ship.</p>

<p>“When I went on deck again I found the wildest excitement.
It was like the old-time stories one used to
read of shipwrecks at sea. I will not say anything about
the crew because I could not say anything good. They
launched fifteen boats but only eight got away. I was
in one of these.... I do not believe the submarine
fired deliberately on the lifeboats. They were trying to
sink the <i>Ancona</i> with shells, but they finally used a torpedo
to send her to the bottom. I looked at my watch
when she took her last plunge. It was 12.45. We were
picked up by the French cruiser <i>Pluton</i> about midnight.”</p>

<p>The commander of the submarine declared, in his official
report, that he had fired only because the <i>Ancona</i>
had tried to escape, that he had ceased firing as soon as
she came to a stop, that the loss of life was due to the
incompetence of the panic-stricken crew of the liner,
whom the Austrian officer allowed forty-five minutes in
which to launch the lifeboats. He admitted, however,
that at the expiration of this time he had torpedoed and
sunk the <i>Ancona</i>, while there were still a number of
people on her decks.</p>

<p>About two hundred of the passengers and crew were
drowned or killed by shellfire. Among them were several
American citizens.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the commander,” declared the
strongly-worded American note of December 6th, “can
only be characterized as wanton slaughter of defenseless
non-combatants.”... The government of the United
States is unwilling ... to credit the Austro-Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
government with an intention to permit its submarines
to destroy the lives of helpless men, women, and children.
It prefers to believe that the commander of the
submarine committed this outrage without authority and
contrary to the general or special instructions which he
had received.</p>

<p>“As the good relations of the two countries must rest
upon a common regard for law and humanity, the government
of the United States cannot be expected to do
otherwise than to denounce the sinking of the <i>Ancona</i>
as an illegal and indefensible act, and to demand that the
officer who perpetrated the deed be punished, and that
reparation by the payment of an indemnity be made for
the citizens of the United States who were killed or injured
by the attack on the vessel.”</p>

<p>This undiplomatic language caused no little resentment
in Vienna. But after a restatement of the Austrian case,
and a much milder rejoinder from Washington, the
American demands were apparently acceded to. In the
second Austro-Hungarian note, which was published in
America on January 1st, 1915, the government of the
Dual-Monarchy disavowed the act of its submarine commander,
declared that he had acted in violation of his
orders and would be punished therefore, and agreed to
pay an indemnity for the American citizens who had been
killed or injured.</p>

<p>“The Imperial and Royal Government,” the note continued,
“agrees thoroughly with the American Cabinet
that the sacred commandments of humanity must be observed
also in war.... The Imperial and Royal Government
can also substantially concur in the principle expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
... that private ships, in so far as they do not
attempt to escape or offer resistance, may not be destroyed
without the persons aboard being brought into
safety.”</p>

<p>Like the settlement of the <i>Arabic</i> case, this was hailed
as a great diplomatic victory for the United States.
Unlike it, there was no question of sharing the credit
with the anti-submarine activities of the Allies, whose
merchant ships in the Mediterranean were being torpedoed
with startling frequency. On December 21st, the
new 12,000 ton Japanese liner <i>Yasaka Maru</i> was sunk
without warning, near Port Said. Thanks to the splendid
discipline of her crew, no lives were lost. There was an
alleged American on board, but there was some irregularity
about his citizenship papers. Nor were there any
Americans aboard the French passenger ship <i>Ville de la
Ciotat</i>, torpedoed on Christmas Eve, with the loss of
seventy lives. There was nothing to mar the smug satisfaction
of the American people on New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>Then came the news of the sinking of the Peninsular
and Oriental liner <i>Persia</i>, on December 30th, off the
Island of Crete.</p>

<p>“I was in the dining room of the <i>Persia</i> at 1.05 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>,”
declares Mr. Charles Grant of Boston, who was one of
the two Americans on board. “I had just finished my
soup, and the steward was asking me what I would take
for my second course, when a terrific explosion occurred.</p>

<p>“The saloon became filled with smoke, broken glass
and steam from the boiler, which appeared to have burst.
There was no panic on board. We went on deck as
though we were at drill, and reported at the lifeboats on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the starboard side, as the vessel had listed to port....</p>

<p>“The last I saw of the <i>Persia</i>, she had her bow in the
air, five minutes after the explosion....</p>

<p>“Robert McNeely, American Consul at Aden, sat at
the same table with me on the voyage. He was not seen,
probably because his cabin was on the port side.</p>

<p>“It was a horrible scene. The water was black as ink.
Some passengers were screaming, others were calling out
good-by. Those in one boat sang hymns.”</p>

<p>The <i>Persia</i> was apparently torpedoed, without warning.
Like the <i>Hesperian</i>, she was armed with a 4.7 gun.
One of the ship’s officers saw the white wake of the
torpedo. But no one saw the submarine.</p>

<p>The commander of that submarine evidently believed,
like Captain Sirius, in striking first and letting the lawyers
talk about it afterwards.</p>

accompanied by a band of four pieces, were distinctly heard above
the surface. This novel concert had been planned by Wilhelm Bauer,
the designer of the submarine and one of the earliest students of
under-water acoustics. He succeeded in signaling from one side
of the harbor to another by striking a submerged piece of sheet-iron

crew, by the British auxiliary <i>Baralong</i>, by referring to various German
outrages.

“Sir Edward Grey offers to submit such incidents, including the

the United States navy.
</p>
<p>
“The Foreign Office has presented to the House of Commons the
full correspondence between Ambassador Page and Sir Edward Grey
concerning the case. A memorandum from Germany concerning the
sinking of the submarine includes affidavits from six Americans who
were muleteers aboard the steamer <i>Nicosian</i> and witnessed the <i>Baralong’s</i>
destruction of the submarine. A further affidavit from Larimore
Holland, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, who was a member of the
crew of the <i>Baralong</i>, was submitted. All the affidavits speak of the
<i>Baralong</i> as disguised and flying the American flag.”</p></div>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
